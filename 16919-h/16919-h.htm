<h3>THE BRADYS AS CUSTOM HOUSE DETECTIVES.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The Collector of the Port of New York sat in his office
in the Custom House with a look of annoyance upon his
face.</p>

<p>Several of his chief inspectors were standing about the
room with the most uneasy expressions, for they were
being censured unmercifully.</p>

<p>"I tell you, gentlemen," the Collector was saying, angrily,
"I am very much disgusted with the poor service your department
is giving. I am determined to stop this wholesale
smuggling. If none of you are capable of doing the work
for which you are liberally paid, I'll have to get somebody
to do the work for you. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"But, sir," began one of the inspectors, humbly, "we've
done our best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And accomplished nothing!" snapped the Collector.</p>

<p>"How could we, sir? The smuggler you want us to catch
does not resort to the usual tricks such people adopt to
avoid paying duty on the diamonds and other precious
stones, which you say are smuggled into this country.
It's because he's such a sly and clever rogue, that we can't
locate him. We've resorted to every known method to discover
the villain, but can't make any headway."</p>

<p>"Then you admit you are beaten?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the hesitating reply.</p>

<p>"Hum!" grunted the Collector, in tones of contempt.
"A nice lot of government detectives you fellows are to
admit such a defeat. However, I've taken the matter into
my own hands now."</p>

<p>"Yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I've engaged two of the most skillful men in the
Secret Service to run down this smuggler. I refer to Old
and Young King Brady."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" sneered the inspector, whose pride was
wounded. "I'm sure if we can't find that smuggler, they
can't."</p>

<p>"They can't, eh?" grimly demanded the Collector. "Well,
you'll find out whether they can or not, Andrew Gibson, for
they'll be here presently to take your work right out of
your hands. Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>With glum looks the inspectors glanced at each other.</p>

<p>It was a bitter pill for them to swallow, to have an outsider
come in to do the work they found themselves unable
to cope with.</p>

<p>Finally Gibson affected a mocking laugh, and said, derisively:</p>

<p>"What can a Secret Service man do in a Custom House
case, if we men, educated for it, can't finish a job we find
too hard for us?"</p>

<p>"They'll find the smuggler I'm after," replied the Collector,
banging his fist on the desk to emphasize his remark.
"I've got every faith in that remarkable man and boy.
They are the most skillful detectives in the profession.
There's nothing they can't do in their own line, and you'll
find it out soon."</p>

<p>"On police and criminal cases&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On <i>any</i> work!" roared the Collector, excitedly.</p>

<p>"They must be marvels, indeed!" sneered Gibson.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>"So they are, sir&mdash;so they are."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see these wonders!"</p>

<p>Just then two men in uniform standing apart from the
rest, advanced.</p>

<p>They wore the costume of boarding officers, the dark-blue
uniforms being garnished with brass buttons and on their
heads were caps with bands across the front bearing the
word in gilt letters, "Inspector."</p>

<p>One of these men was tall and muscular, with a bushy
black beard, deep gray eyes and a heavy mass of dark-brown
hair.</p>

<p>His companion looked like a mere boy, with a handsome
face, a pair of keen eyes and a dashing, aggressive air that
showed he was of a bold, intrepid character. He walked
right up to the inspector.</p>

<p>"So you want to see the Bradys, do you?" he asked
Gibson, quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would," asserted the inspector, glaring at him
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Then look, for we are the Bradys!" exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>He took off his cap and his companion stripped off a
wig and false beard.</p>

<p>Every one in the room glanced at them in amazement.</p>

<p>No one suspected their identity before.</p>

<p>Old King Brady was now seen to have white hair and a
clean-shaven face, in which a daring, determined character
was shown.</p>

<p>Even the Collector was astonished.</p>

<p>When he recovered his composure, a smile crossed his
face, and he rose and warmly shook hands with the pair,
saying:</p>

<p>"Well, this is an agreeable surprise."</p>

<p>Old King Brady smiled, took a chew of tobacco and
replied:</p>

<p>"You got our chief to assign us on this case and requested
us to be here at two o'clock, and here we are."</p>

<p>"Ready for work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Instruct us."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can tell you is that this country is being
flooded with precious stones upon which no duty is being
paid, and I want you to find the party who is doing the
crooked work."</p>

<p>"Have you any clews upon which we can work?"</p>

<p>"None, whatever. You'll have to get them yourselves
from the importers in John street, Broadway and Maiden
Lane. They may give you some points."</p>

<p>"We shall follow your suggestion."</p>

<p>The two detectives started for the door, then paused.</p>

<p>Harry Brady, the boy, then said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Gibson has some doubts about our ability to work
for the Custom House. Since he has flung defiance at
us, we'll accept his challenge."</p>

<p>"How? growled the inspector, in ugly tones.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll meet you officers and the Collector on board
the steamer Campania, of the Cunard line, in one hour,
when she reaches her pier from Quarantine. If we don't
show up more smugglers than you do, we'll give up this
assignment."</p>

<p>"I'll go you!" eagerly exclaimed the jealous inspector.</p>

<p>"And I'll be there to see that you get fair play," grimly
said the Collector.</p>

<p>The Bradys silently bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>When they reached the street, Old King Brady laughed
and said:</p>

<p>"They're all jealous of us. But we'll show them a trick
or two, Harry."</p>

<p>"They'll be a surprised lot," laughed the boy. "We
have them beaten already."</p>

<p>They headed for the jewelry district and called upon
several of the most prominent importers and lapidaries,
from whom they gained some very valuable information.
The last importer they spoke to said:</p>

<p>"Paul La Croix, a French-Canadian, was just in here
with his daughter, trying to sell us some smuggled diamonds.
See&mdash;there he goes now."</p>

<p>He pointed out the window at a tall, thin, stylishly-clad
man of forty in light trousers, a black frock coat and high
hat.</p>

<p>The detectives observed that he now did not have his
daughter with him.</p>

<p>From where they were, they could see that La Croix had
a thin, sallow face, a long, sharp nose and a closely-trimmed
dark moustache.</p>

<p>He turned into Broadway and disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Old King Brady, of the dealer in
precious stones.</p>

<p>"A mystery. No one knows. He makes many trips
between New York and Havre to smuggle diamonds which
he sells here. Every jeweler in the Lane knows him. Some
deal with him."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"At the Fifth Avenue Hotel."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>And a moment later the detectives were gone.</p>

<p>Reaching Broadway they hurried ahead intending to
find La Croix and arrest him with contraband diamonds in
his possession.</p>

<p>But the man disappeared and they found no trace of him.</p>

<p>The Bradys gave up the hunt, temporarily, for they were
determined to find the man again.</p>

<p>They crossed the city, going to the west side.</p>

<p>People who saw the pair paid no heed to them now, for
they had made some changes in their apparel, in a sheltering
doorway, and by turning their coats inside out, pocketing
their uniform hats and putting on soft felt hats, they
transformed their appearance.</p>

<p>They now looked like ordinary citizens.</p>

<p>Each one adjusted a false moustache and a wig to hide
his identity.</p>

<p>They had their clothing so made that they could change
to several characters with but little trouble.</p>

<p>This fact was well known to most of the crooks at large,
and they feared the Bradys more than any other detectives
on the force.</p>

<p>Although they bore the same name, there was no relationship
between them, for Harry was merely an apt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>pupil the old detective had chanced to meet, and was
educating in his profession.</p>

<p>As a team, they made themselves famous.</p>

<p>When they drew near the Cunard steamship dock, Old
King Brady carried his handkerchief in his hand as a
signal.</p>

<p>A man was on the lookout and ran up to him.</p>

<p>Handing the detective a letter he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I followed your order, Mr. Brady and went down to
Quarantine to-day with the port doctor. He took me
aboard the Campania, and I found out a great deal. It's all
written in that letter. I wrote it coming up on the Custom
House tug."</p>

<p>"Has the steamer reached her dock yet?"</p>

<p>"She's swinging in now. I beat her up on the tug."</p>

<p>"Very well. You may go."</p>

<p>The spotter hastened away and the detectives eagerly read
his letter.</p>

<p>It was full of valuable information for which they sent
the man and having read the letter they hastened to the
pier.</p>

<p>The big trans-Atlantic steamer was just tying up to
her dock and the detectives saw the Collector and his inspectors
standing on the pier waiting for the passengers
to land.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>NINE SMUGGLERS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>A scene of great animation and excitement was soon
transpiring on the pier.</p>

<p>Passengers were swarming down the gangplank of the
big steamer, crowds of friends were waiting to greet them,
porters and waiters were landing the baggage on the dock
and stevedores were preparing to discharge the cargo.</p>

<p>The two Bradys took up a favorable position and calling
the purser of the steamer, they induced him to point out
several people whose names they mentioned.</p>

<p>These people were the ones whom they had spotted as
smugglers.</p>

<p>Presently the owners of the baggage began opening their
trunks and valises so the inspectors could examine their
effects.</p>

<p>While this was going on the Bradys joined the Collector
and spoke to him. He was startled to discover their
identity and remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly have the faculty of hiding your
identity in the most complete manner. Have you found
any smugglers yet?"</p>

<p>"Several," replied Harry, quickly.</p>

<p>"Indeed! Who are they?"</p>

<p>"We'll show you when your men get through."</p>

<p>They chatted together until the inspection was finished
and all the luggage had been marked and received the
pasters to show they were passed.</p>

<p>"Now call your men and get their report, sir," said
Harry.</p>

<p>The Collector did as he was requested.</p>

<p>Out of several hundred passengers only a lace shawl had
been captured.</p>

<p>"Is that all you managed to find that was dutiable?"
asked Harry, in surprise, as the searchers gathered round
them.</p>

<p>They recognized him by his voice and Gibson growled
sarcastically:</p>

<p>"Do you think you can do any better?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to see you do it."</p>

<p>"So we shall. Let us begin with Mrs. Harvey. Open
her trunk again."</p>

<p>Despite the lady's protests this was done.</p>

<p>Pointing at the tray, Harry said, coolly:</p>

<p>"Pick up that cake of toilet soap, cut it in two and you'll
find a very valuable gentleman's ruby ring and scarf pin
buried inside of it."</p>

<p>Gibson complied with a poor grace.</p>

<p>As Harry said, he disclosed the articles mentioned.</p>

<p>"My!" said the lady, innocently, "I wonder how they got
there?"</p>

<p>"Madam," replied Harry, politely, "you put them there
yourself. As a lady don't wear such things and you've
been traveling alone, it's clear you were trying to smuggle
those things. Seize them, Gibson, and they'll be appraised
in the Custom House. If the lady then wishes to pay the
full duty charged on them she can get back her ornaments."</p>

<p>The Collector burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Any more?" he asked Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"Yes. See that short fat man? He is Mr. Jacobs, a
stock broker. I guess we'll have to pull off the gentleman's
left boot. Hey, Mr. Jacobs!"</p>

<p>"Vell?" growled the fat broker, glancing at the detective
in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Sit down on your trunk, please," said Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"Vot for?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you in a moment."</p>

<p>The broker sat down and Harry seized him and held
him there.</p>

<p>At the same moment Old King Brady grabbed him by
the left foot, gave it a tug and the struggling man gave
a yell, and demanded, excitedly, as the boot slipped off and
remained in the detective's hand:</p>

<p>"Py shiminey, vot yer mean py dot outrages alretty?"</p>

<p>"We think you are cheating the government," replied Old
King Brady.</p>

<p>"Vot? Me? You vas grazy!"</p>

<p>"Am I?" blandly asked Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"Sure you are! Vot mein boot vas got mit it ter do?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you, my innocent friend," grimly replied the
old detective, as he drew out his pocket knife.</p>

<p>With the large blade he removed the first layer of leather
from the heel and showed that the heel was hollow.</p>

<p>Lying within this neat little opening was a small paper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>package which the detective drew out. Opening the paper
he showed its contents.</p>

<p>It consisted of five magnificent diamonds.</p>

<p>The broker gave a gasp of horror and Old King Brady
said to him sweetly:</p>

<p>"You forgot to put these on the manifest, Mr. Jacobs,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Och, Gott!</i>" groaned the unlucky broker, in deep
anguish of spirit, "I vas ruint vunct. Vot vill I do?
Vot vill I do?"</p>

<p>"Pay the duty and redeem them from the Custom
House," replied the detective, and the gems were seized on
the spot.</p>

<p>All the inspectors looked envious of the two detectives.</p>

<p>The Collector regarded them with a cold glance and
finally asked:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you find these things?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know they had 'em," sheepishly replied Gibson.</p>

<p>"We ain't half through yet," said Harry at this juncture.</p>

<p>"What else have you discovered?" demanded the Collector,
curiously.</p>

<p>"Several hundred yards of fine point lace."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"In a false bottom under Miss Daisy Linden's trunk.
See&mdash;there she stands&mdash;that handsome big actress there.
Do you think she's as fat as she looks? Well, just notice how
big around her body is, and how thin her arms and neck are.
If you'll get one of the lady inspectors to examine her privately,
you'll find she's got several valuable oil paintings
wrapped around her body, under her clothes."</p>

<p>The woman made a great fuss when they insisted upon
rummaging in her trunk a second time and reluctantly
opened it again.</p>

<p>Harry threw everything out and the woman shrieked,
scolded and protested. But when the boy opened the false
bottom of the trunk and withdrew the lace he mentioned,
she fainted.</p>

<p>When the actress came to, she found that a lady inspector
had disrobed her in a stateroom on the steamer and taken
five very costly paintings away, which she was smuggling
under her clothes.</p>

<p>By the time the Bradys finished, they had nine smugglers
exposed, and fully quarter of a million dollars' worth
of valuables were seized.</p>

<p>The Collector had been watching these proceedings with
deep interest.</p>

<p>When his own men reached him, he said to them:</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of you. Here you let two absolutely green
men step in and do the work you've been at for years, much
better than you do it yourselves."</p>

<p>"Well," grimly admitted Gibson, "they've kept their
boast and beaten us badly, I'm sorry to say. I don't need
to wish them luck for they've got either a large amount of
it, or else they had some inside information."</p>

<p>"Your latter surmise is the correct one," said Harry.
"We sent a man down the bay to meet the steamer. People
who are going to smuggle anything rarely take pains to
conceal their contraband goods till they are nearing port.
We know something about the matter, you see. Moreover,
we know would-be smugglers who don't make a profession
of it are very careless, talkative about what they are going
to smuggle, and apt to give themselves away. By sending
a good, smart spotter ahead we learned all about the people
we've exposed."</p>

<p>"That game may work very nicely with amateurs. But
it would not go with a professional smuggler by any
means."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," assented Harry.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Collector, "I'm quite satisfied with
your performance, Mr. Brady, and am convinced that you
are the very men to run down the big smuggler I am so
anxious to see arrested."</p>

<p>"We'll do our best," said Old King Brady.</p>

<p>The Collector and the inspectors then went away.</p>

<p>As they were leaving the pier, the quick, keen eyes of
Harry observed a young girl on the steamer acting in a
mysterious manner.</p>

<p>She was standing in the gangway, peering out one of
the port holes and sharply watching the departing officials.</p>

<p>Every time one of them chanced to glance back, she
suddenly dodged down behind the bulwark out of sight.</p>

<p>She was a beautiful girl of about sixteen, handsomely
clad in a short dress and zouave waist of fine silk, while
a stylish big Gainsborough hat with black ostrich plumes
crowned her short, yellow, curly hair.</p>

<p>Her skin was as white as milk and she had a pair of big
brown eyes, a pretty little Grecian nose and rosebud lips.</p>

<p>Young King Brady was charmed with her beauty, yet his
suspicions of her actions were aroused to the fever point.</p>

<p>He touched his partner on the arm and pointed at her.</p>

<p>"See there!" he exclaimed. "What can she be up to?"</p>

<p>"We'd better keep an eye on her, Harry," returned the old
detective, after a careful survey. "It looks to me as if she
were up to some trick. She wouldn't be watching those inspectors'
departure that way unless it was of vital importance
to her."</p>

<p>"But surely she can't be so silly as to think there are no
officers left here. Everyone knows that a couple remain constantly
on the watch in their office at the entrance to the
dock."</p>

<p>"Ha! What's that? She's waving her handkerchief to
that man who is coming out on the pier from West street."</p>

<p>Young King Brady gazed keenly at the person in question
and suddenly recognizing him he exclaimed in excited
tones:</p>

<p>"Why, it's Paul La Croix, the diamond smuggler!"</p>

<p>"So it is, by thunder!"</p>

<p>"And this beautiful girl must be his daughter, for she
greatly resembles him."</p>

<p>"Harry, I believe that pair are up to some crooked
work!"</p>

<p>"We can find out by watching them."</p>

<p>La Croix now went aboard the steamer and joined the
girl in the gangway.</p>

<h3>CAUGHT IN AN ELEVATOR.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The Bradys felt convinced that the smuggler and his
daughter were working some scheme to take some valuables
ashore, duty free.</p>

<p>Closely watching the pair they saw them enter the cabin.</p>

<p>Following them in, the Bradys observed the pair gliding
swiftly down a passage, out on which opened the doors of
several staterooms.</p>

<p>La Croix and his daughter entered one of these rooms.</p>

<p>Rushing forward, the Bradys listened outside the partition
and heard the man ask:</p>

<p>"Did you geet eet, Clara?"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa," replied the girl in a low, pleasant tone of
voice. "After I left you on Maiden Lane, I came right here
and mingled with the throng waiting to meet the various
passengers. As soon as the gangplank was down, I slipped
aboard and met the steward. He had the parcel and gave
it to me."</p>

<p>"Open eet so we can distribute ze jewelry about our
pairsons. Zen we geet ze sings ashore ver' easy, an' no wong
weel see ze package bulge out our clothing. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, but
I vas ver'&mdash;vot you call&mdash;ze&mdash;ze&mdash;worried."</p>

<p>The crackling of paper was heard.</p>

<p>For a few moments afterward there ensued a deep silence.</p>

<p>Old King Brady silently beckoned to Harry and they retreated
a few paces.</p>

<p>"I'm going right in after La Croix," he whispered.</p>

<p>"We've got him dead to rights," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared for a fight?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I've got a powerful persuader in my hip
pocket."</p>

<p>"Then come on with me."</p>

<p>He strode forward and pushed the stateroom door open.</p>

<p>It opened inward and as the room was very small, it
pushed La Croix against the two bunks and wrung the
startled cry from his lips:</p>

<p>"Look out, Clara!"</p>

<p>The girl glared at the detectives and demanded:</p>

<p>"What do you want in here?"</p>

<p>"That man!" said Harry, pointing at her father.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Smuggling!"</p>

<p>"He isn't!"</p>

<p>"We'll search him and see."</p>

<p>The Bradys grasped the excited Frenchman.</p>

<p>His clothing in the region of his stomach was bulging
suspiciously and Old King Brady slapped the spot and
demanded:</p>

<p>"What have you got there?"</p>

<p>"Nosing!" protested La Croix. "Zees ees an outrage,
sair!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know!" laughed Harry.</p>

<p>"Clara!" roared the man. "Go tell ze captaine, quick, to
come 'ere."</p>

<p>The girl slipped out the door and vanished.</p>

<p>Left alone with the man, the detectives laughed and
Harry said:</p>

<p>"Unbutton your coat and vest."</p>

<p>"<i>Sacre!</i> For why?" growled La Croix.</p>

<p>"We want to see what you've got stuffed in there."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you wrong me!"</p>

<p>"Bosh! Open up quick, or we'll do it for you."</p>

<p>La Croix reluctantly opened his vest and a package
dropped out.</p>

<p>He then was of normal size.</p>

<p>"This is what we are after!" laughed Harry, picking up
the parcel.</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur, eet ees only a worthless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, sir!"</p>

<p>And Harry opened the mysterious parcel.</p>

<p>It was filled with sawdust.</p>

<p>The man laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and asked:</p>

<p>"Veil, sair, you ees satisfied?"</p>

<p>There was a look of disgust on Harry's face and he cried:</p>

<p>"He has cleverly duped us and the girl got away with
the valuables."</p>

<p>Old King Brady was furious.</p>

<p>"Confound her!" he roared. "Come&mdash;search this man
thoroughly, and if he has not got any contraband stuff,
we'll search the ship and arrest the girl."</p>

<p>Harry turned La Croix's pockets inside out.</p>

<p>Nothing was found upon his person.</p>

<p>Then they searched the room.</p>

<p>Still nothing came to light and Harry said:</p>

<p>"He has nothing with him."</p>

<p>"Very well. The girl has, then."</p>

<p>"Now, Monsieur, I hope you see zat you wrong me?" said
La Croix.</p>

<p>Old King Brady gave him a peculiar look, shook his
finger at the Frenchman and replied in angry tones:</p>

<p>"We know you, La Croix. You are the worst smuggler
in this port. It won't be long before we run you in for
your crooked work."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;how you can say zat?" innocently asked the man.</p>

<p>"We have no time to discuss the matter now, for we are
very anxious to nab your daughter Clara," said the old detective.
"But you will meet us again very soon. Then look
out!"</p>

<p>They hastened out of the stateroom.</p>

<p>Once outside Harry whispered hastily:</p>

<p>"You go ahead and I'll fool him."</p>

<p>He thereupon slipped into an adjoining room.</p>

<p>Old King Brady knew at once what the boy wanted to
do, and he left the cabin and began to search the ship for
the girl.</p>

<p>La Croix was peering cautiously from the room he was
in and seeing the old detective disappearing out the door,
he emerged.</p>

<p>Watching Old King Brady to see that his own actions
were not observed, the smuggler finally left the steamer
with Harry at his heels in a change of appearance which
even his keen eyes failed to penetrate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Old King Brady saw them depart.</p>

<p>He transformed his own appearance.</p>

<p>Both he and Harry now had assumed their natural looks.</p>

<p>There was a big white felt hat on the old detective's head,
his frock coat of dark-blue was buttoned up to the neck,
around which there now was a standing collar and an old-fashioned
stock and on his hands were cotton gloves.</p>

<p>The boy's suit of brown plaid, and a bicycle cap on his
head, were much different from the reverse side of his
clothing and the other hat he had worn.</p>

<p>In the street Harry saw the man hail a cab and get in.</p>

<p>He saw his partner and beckoned to him.</p>

<p>When they met, Harry asked eagerly:</p>

<p>"Did you find the girl?"</p>

<p>"No. She must have hurried from the steamer."</p>

<p>"Well, La Croix is bound to meet her now."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Our plan is to keep him shadowed."</p>

<p>"See if we can't get a cab, too."</p>

<p>They pursued the carriage on foot as far as Eighth avenue
before they encountered a public hack and got in.</p>

<p>Instructing the driver to pursue the other vehicle, they
were carried up to Fourteenth street, across town to Broadway
and thence up to Twenty-third street.</p>

<p>La Croix's vehicle paused before the Fifth Avenue Hotel
and he alighted.</p>

<p>"We were not misinformed about his address," commented
Harry.</p>

<p>"No. He is probably going in there to meet the girl."</p>

<p>"Let's get out here at the Arch so as not to attract his
attention."</p>

<p>"Very well. Be careful now."</p>

<p>They dismissed the cab and hurried into the hotel.</p>

<p>La Croix had disappeared from view and the detectives
hastened to the office and said to the clerk:</p>

<p>"Got a party here named La Croix?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. They're in room 678. Wish to send up your
name?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Old King Brady, with a smile, as he exhibited
his badge.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the clerk, "detective, eh?"</p>

<p>"We're after La Croix. He's a crook."</p>

<p>"He is? What has he done?"</p>

<p>"Smuggler."</p>

<p>"I see. How about his wife and daughter?"</p>

<p>"They must be in his game too."</p>

<p>"Going to pull them in?"</p>

<p>"Probably. Is he in his room?"</p>

<p>"He just went up the stairs."</p>

<p>"I wish we could reach his apartments ahead of him."</p>

<p>"So you can by going up in the elevator. It's on the top
floor."</p>

<p>"Well try it."</p>

<p>They hastened over to the elevators and found that the
only one down was one which had no conductor in it. As
they did not wish to lose time, they both got in, shut the
door and pulled the wire cable.</p>

<p>Up they glided, story after story, without seeing him
ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>He had gone up in an elevator from the floor above.</p>

<p>Above on the beams over the elevator shaft La Croix was
crouching with a big hatchet in his hand, as he peered down
at the people ascending in the cars.</p>

<p>He had detected them in pursuit and expecting trouble,
he was waiting to give the detectives a warm reception.
He evidently recognized them without their disguises.</p>

<p>As he caught view of his pursuers coming up in the car,
he picked up the hatchet he had found lying on the beam.</p>

<p>Raising it above his head, he brought it down upon the
cable by which the car was suspended, with all his strength.</p>

<p>The shock caused the Bradys to look up and they saw
what he was doing.</p>

<p>Bang! went the keen blade upon the cable again where
it crossed the wheel.</p>

<p>The weight of the car caused the wire rope to part where
he cut it, and the elevator's ascent was checked.</p>

<p>It began to fall with the detectives in it.</p>

<h3>THE CLEW IN THE BASIN.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>A cry of alarm escaped Old King Brady when he saw
the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Harry," he gasped, "he is trying to kill us."</p>

<p>"There goes the cable!" muttered the boy, and a cold
chill darted through him as he heard the ominous snap of
the parting strands.</p>

<p>"The safety-clutch may save us, Harry."</p>

<p>"No! It don't work," groaned the boy as the car shot
down.</p>

<p>A sickening sensation passed through the pair as the
falling car went plunging down at lightning speed.</p>

<p>They expected to get dashed to death at the bottom as
they went flying down past the different floors, and heard a
fiendish chuckle from the Frenchman above their heads.</p>

<p>Like rats in a trap, the two detectives were held so they
could do nothing to aid themselves.</p>

<p>All they could do was to wait for the final crash, and
visions of the wrecked car and their bodies crushed to a
pulp flashed across their minds.</p>

<p>The desperation of their situation was appalling.</p>

<p>The speed of their fall took their breath away and both
instinctively grasped the sides of the car and clung to it
tenaciously.</p>

<p>Down three stories they plunged.</p>

<p>Then there suddenly sounded a sharp "click."</p>

<p>The car paused, slid a few feet, then came to a sudden
stop.</p>

<p>At the last moment the clutches flew out and tightened
on the pilot rods, holding the falling car in midair.</p>

<p>The sudden stopping hurled the detectives to the floor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>but they quickly scrambled to their feet, overjoyed at their
salvation.</p>

<p>For an instant neither could speak.</p>

<p>To be so suddenly snatched from the very jaws of death
was such a strain upon their nerves that they could hardly
stand it.</p>

<p>Old King Brady was the first to recover, and glancing
upward he saw that their enemy had disappeared from the
beam overhead.</p>

<p>"By thunder!" he exclaimed. "La Croix is baffled!"</p>

<p>"I never expected such good luck," replied Harry, delightedly.</p>

<p>"The car is holding, all right."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how are we to get out of it?"</p>

<p>They were caught midway between the second and third
floors.</p>

<p>But the parting of the cable had been detected by the
engineer and the conductor of an ascending car in the next
shaft as the falling elevator flew down past him, and help
was coming.</p>

<p>As the news spread, people flocked out in the hall, filled
with dread lest the two officers had been killed.</p>

<p>They peered down the shafts through the grill work and
when some saw the car, a shout of relief went up, and a
man yelled at the Bradys:</p>

<p>"Were you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No. We are all right, so far."</p>

<p>"Wait, and we'll have the car lowered."</p>

<p>Up came men with ropes, and the end of a line was passed
down from the floor above the car and Old King Brady
made it fast.</p>

<p>When the danger of the car falling was obviated, another
gang secured the cut cable, passed it over the drum,
brought it down to the roof of the car and spliced it to the
piece remaining there.</p>

<p>The elevator was then lowered to the ground floor and
opening the door the detectives passed out, none the worse
for their adventure.</p>

<p>A crowd of anxious people surrounded them, but they
quickly avoided them by dodging into another car and saying
to the conductor:</p>

<p>"Top floor&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>Bang! went the gate and up they shot.</p>

<p>Reaching the upper story the detectives made a rush for
the room La Croix had been occupying and found it empty.</p>

<p>"The birds have flown!" muttered Old King Brady in
disgust.</p>

<p>"No wonder. We were caged up in the elevator so long
they had ample time."</p>

<p>"They may have left some clew behind. Let us search
the room."</p>

<p>This was done, and in the slop basin they found a letter
torn up in small pieces.</p>

<p>Harry carefully gathered up the fragments and put them
in his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"It's written in French," he commented, "but it may be
of some use. I'll put the pieces together and we'll have it
translated."</p>

<p>They failed to find anything else and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Returning to the clerk, they asked if La Croix had been
seen.</p>

<p>"He did not come out this way," replied the man, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"Positive!"</p>

<p>"Well, he and his family are gone."</p>

<p>"Ain't they up in their room?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That's queer."</p>

<p>"Not at all. You heard how the elevator fell with us?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, La Croix saw us and cut the cable."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Tried to kill you?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. That's why they fled."</p>

<p>"What a villain that fellow must be."</p>

<p>"Is there any other exit from here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I'll have a boy show you."</p>

<p>He rang a hand-bell and a uniformed boy approached, to
whom he gave an order and the Bradys were escorted away.</p>

<p>By questioning the help they soon found that the smuggler,
his wife and his daughter had left the hotel by another
exit.</p>

<p>A policeman in the street had seen them hire a cab and
drive away through Broadway at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>Unable to learn anything else, the detectives went home.
They had very comfortable apartments and spent the day
there piecing out the torn letter so it could be read.</p>

<p>On the following day they had it translated, and read
the following startling piece of information:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="right">"Paris, France, May 19.</p>

<p>"My dear La Croix: In reply to yours of the 5th inst.,
I beg to say that I can easily meet your daughter at Havre,
if she comes over on the Champagne. I shall then take her
to Amsterdam, Holland, and procure the fifty packages of
diamonds. She can then assume a fictitious name and take
passage on the steamer Labrador, to Canada. You can
meet her in Montreal, and the stones can be taken across
the border at Niagara Falls, as you suggest. Should you
follow this plan, wire me at once, and I shall so arrange
matters that the American spies for the Customs officials
who are on the lookout here shall know knothing about the
transaction. Everything depends upon keeping this a
secret from them, or they will cable back to the U.S. inspectors
to keep a watch for Clara when she returns to
Canada&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>The letter ended abruptly here, for the rest was missing.</p>

<p>But there was enough to expose the whole plan of smuggling
a huge amount of diamonds into the United States.</p>

<p>The Bradys were astonished and Harry said at once:</p>

<p>"This letter proves that La Croix must be the gigantic
smuggler whom the Customs department want run down."</p>

<p>"No question about it," replied Old King Brady. "And
as we have the details of a scheme he intends to operate,
we had better make preparations to nip the plan in the bud,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>or else to capture the girl smuggler when she makes her attempt
to beat the Custom House."</p>

<p>"Are you aware that the steamer Champagne sails for
Havre to-day?"</p>

<p>"Does she?" muttered Old King Brady, glancing at his
watch. "Well, we'll barely have time to reach her if we
go at once. Get a cab and we'll see if we can catch her
before she departs."</p>

<p>"Even if we miss her," said Harry, consolingly, "we will
be pretty sure to see La Croix on the pier, seeing his
daughter off."</p>

<p>"I don't want to arrest him in that case," said Old King
Brady, "for if the girl gets away, we'll have to keep the man
watched in order to let him lead us to his daughter when
she returns. As she's pretty sure to have all those diamonds
with her, we can nab them with evidence on their persons,
of their smuggling enterprise."</p>

<p>Harry nodded and they hurried out together.</p>

<p>A hack was engaged and they rode over to the French
Trans-Atlantic Company's pier on the North river.</p>

<p>By the time the cab reached the dock, however, the steamship's
mooring lines had been cast off, the gangplank was
down and the vessel was being pulled out into the stream.</p>

<p>The detectives were disappointed.</p>

<p>Eagerly scanning the throng of passengers on the upper
deck, they suddenly caught view of Clara La Croix.</p>

<p>The girl was standing in the stern waving her handkerchief
and shouting to a stylishly-dressed middle-aged
woman on the stringpiece:</p>

<p>"Good-by, mamma!"</p>

<p>"Farewell, Clara&mdash;be very careful of yourself, my child!"
replied the woman, as she waved her handkerchief back at
the girl.</p>

<p>Harry nudged Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"There's her mother," he muttered, "but La Croix has
not shown up. He fears arrest now, as he knows we are
after him."</p>

<p>"So much the better," replied the old detective, drily.
"This woman won't know us. It will therefore be all the
easier to follow her undetected."</p>

<p>The steamship soon went down the river and the friends
and relatives of the departing passengers began to leave
the pier.</p>

<p>Mrs. La Croix was one of the last to go. She did not
know that the Bradys were close behind her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>AT A VILLAIN'S MERCY.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The smuggler's wife leisurely left the pier, crossed the
street and went in the direction of Sixth avenue, on foot.</p>

<p>It did not seem to occur to her that she might be followed,
for she never once glanced back in the direction she came
from.</p>

<p>Old King Brady and his partner did not know much
about the woman.</p>

<p>Whether she was actually concerned in La Croix's smuggling
games or not, they had not the faintest idea.</p>

<p>She was a fine-looking woman, tall and stately, with
brown hair, blue eyes and handsome features. But she
seldom laughed.</p>

<p>Hers was one of those set, inscrutable faces, hard to read,
for she seldom showed the emotions preying upon her mind.</p>

<p>"She don't seem to fear detection," commented Harry,
as they walked along. "She hasn't made the slightest effort
to conceal her actions."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the old detective, as he thoughtfully
took a fresh quid of tobacco, "you must not forget that
the woman isn't aware of the fact that we are on her trail."</p>

<p>"She certainly must be interested in her husband's
crooked work or she would not see her daughter off to
Europe in this manner. In fact, if she were not so greatly
interested, I doubt if she would allow her child to make such
a long, dangerous trip alone."</p>

<p>"Your reasoning is very sensible," commented Old King
Brady, "but you must recollect that the girl smuggler is
very smart. She is used to danger. This may not be her
first voyage abroad alone. In fact, she has probably been
making many trips to the other side, bringing back jewels
to be smuggled ashore."</p>

<p>"Judging by what that letter said," remarked Harry,
"the man and his wife are likely to go to Canada now and
wait there for the girl's return with that large consignment
of precious stones. We shall be obliged to follow them
there. We can't arrest them now on suspicion, nor can
we pull La Croix in for trying to murder us in the Fifth
Avenue Hotel elevator. If we do, it will interfere with
our capturing the girl when she returns with those jewels."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to say your view of the matter is correct,
Harry."</p>

<p>"There goes the woman up Sixth avenue. She's a good
walker. It looks to me as if she were heading for the
French district in the neighborhood of Third street. Queer
she didn't ride."</p>

<p>They tracked her to West Broadway.</p>

<p>Here she suddenly turned into the hall of a very old
house across the front of which hung the sign of an artificial
flower maker.</p>

<p>Old King Brady passed into the hall after her and Harry
remained on guard at the door.</p>

<p>Going up a flight of stairs, the woman knocked at a
door and when it was opened, she passed into a room, closing
the door after her.</p>

<p>The detective glided over to the door and listened.</p>

<p>Voices were heard inside, a man crying out eagerly:</p>

<p>"Well, Lena, ees ze child gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Paul," Mrs. La Croix replied, in sad tones. "The
Champagne just departed with our daughter. We shall
not see her for a month."</p>

<p>"Ah, but when she return we make ze largest stake of
our lives."</p>

<p>"I wish this risky business was ended, Paul. I'm getting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>sick of it. We do not lead the peaceful lives of other
people. It is a constant excitement and fear of police
interference."</p>

<p>"Do not complain, Lena. Zees ees ze last treep ze child
make. Eef eet ees wong success, we make so much dollaires
zat we can retiaire an' leeve ze life of ease for ze
rest of our days, by gar!"</p>

<p>He laughed and the woman replied, resignedly:</p>

<p>"Well, I hope your dream will come true, Paul."</p>

<p>"Take zees seat an' 'ave your suppair, my dear. You
need ze rest, for to-night we leave New York by rail for
Canada, for I have sold all ze stones I had, an' mail my
draft to Paris."</p>

<p>Old King Brady smiled and muttered:</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've told me your business, old fellow."</p>

<p>The shadows of twilight had fallen by this time and the
hall was getting dark.</p>

<p>Hearing some one coming downstairs from an upper
floor, the old detective retreated along the hall and crouched
back in a doorway.</p>

<p>He pressed himself back flat against the door hoping the
person who was coming would pass him in the gloom without
observing his presence.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the door behind him was not shut tight.</p>

<p>As he pressed his back against it, it flew inward all of a
sudden and pitching over backward, the detective fell
sprawling upon the floor of a small room adjoining the one
occupied by La Croix and his wife.</p>

<p>He heard the Frenchman utter a startled cry.</p>

<p>Like a tiger he sprang into the room and saw the detective.</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu!</i>" he hissed, a look of rage and hate upon his
dark face. "Ze secret police. Watching me, eh? I show
you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>He seized an iron bar standing in the corner and as the
old detective was upon the point of scrambling to his feet,
he dealt the officer a fearful blow that knocked him senseless.</p>

<p>He just had time to bang the door shut to prevent the
person who was coming from upstairs from seeing what
was going on.</p>

<p>Just then his wife rushed in.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Paul?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Old King Brady!" he replied, pointing at the old detective
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Ah;" was her cool reply. "He has found our refuge,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. An' probable he has been listen to our talk."</p>

<p>"That is very dangerous for us, Paul."</p>

<p>"Not since I 'ave him at my mercy. <i>Sacriste!</i> When
I geet through wiz heem now, he not weel trouble us again
een wong hurry."</p>

<p>Fearing the detective might recover he got a piece of
rope and bound and gagged Old King Brady.</p>

<p>When this was done an idea suddenly flashed across his
mind, and he bounded to his feet and exclaimed, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Where ees ze othair?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," his wife replied.</p>

<p>"Young King Brady."</p>

<p>"Do they always travel together?"</p>

<p>"Sairtainly."</p>

<p>"Then the boy must be lurking near here."</p>

<p>"Wait. I find heem eef I can."</p>

<p>He hastened from the room and made a search of the
hall. Then he quietly passed downstairs and there caught
view of the young detective keeping guard outside the street
door.</p>

<p>The Frenchman was greatly excited.</p>

<p>He retreated into the hall and went upstairs again, muttering:</p>

<p>"I must geet zat boy een my powair just as queek as possible.
So long as ze Bradys ees on my track, I may go to
ze preeson at any moment. It makes me nairvous, by gar!"</p>

<p>He took up a position at the head of the stairs, wondering
how he could get the best of the detectives.</p>

<p>Convinced that they knew all about his smuggling business
and would arrest him at the first opportunity, it made
him so desperate that he would not have hesitated to kill
both of them.</p>

<p>He had not been standing at the head of the stairs long
before he saw Harry glide into the hall as quietly as a
shadow.</p>

<p>The boy was becoming impatient over his partner's long
absence and made up his mind to find him.</p>

<p>Searching the lower hall, he failed to see anything of
Old King Brady and then cautiously made his way upstairs.</p>

<p>The Frenchman saw him coming.</p>

<p>He slipped into the room where the old detective lay.</p>

<p>Raising his finger to his wife, he hissed:</p>

<p>"Hush! He coming up ze stair! Put out ze light&mdash;hurry!"</p>

<p>Keeping the door open on a crack when darkness fell
upon the room, he peered out and listened intently.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see anything.</p>

<p>But he heard the young detective's soft footfalls passing
the door and he stepped out into the hall behind Harry.</p>

<p>Slight as the noise was which he made, the boy heard
him and turned around, striving to pierce the gloom with
his sight.</p>

<p>La Croix had the boy located.</p>

<p>He suddenly sprang forward with both hands extended,
struck against the boy, clutched him by the throat and
knocked him over backward.</p>

<p>A stifled cry escaped Harry.</p>

<p>He was knocked down and struck the floor with a crash.</p>

<p>As his head went back, with the Frenchman's grip on
his windpipe, his skull banged against the door-casing.</p>

<p>He was stunned.</p>

<p>"Lena! Lena!" roared La Croix.</p>

<p>"What is it, Paul?" asked the woman, appearing in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Breeng a light&mdash;queek!" he panted.</p>

<p>She struck a match and he saw that Harry was senseless.</p>

<p>With a look of evil triumph on his dark face, the man
seized the boy, dragged him into the room and his wife
locked the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>La Croix bound and gagged Harry.</p>

<p>"Got zem both!" he chuckled.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with them, Paul?" demanded
his wife.</p>

<p>"Do wiz zem? Put zem out of ze way, my dear. Dispose
of zem so effectually zat we not weel be trouble wiz zem
again."</p>

<p>The woman met his evil glance and shuddered.</p>

<p>She saw what murderous thoughts were filling his mind.</p>

<h3>TWO MEN IN A BOX.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>On the following morning Paul La Croix went upstairs
to the man who made artificial flowers and said to him:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Reynard, to-day ve go avay to Europe. I 'ave
some sings een ze rooms ve occupy zat I weesh to send to
a friend een Sacramento. To do so, I must 'ave wong beeg
packing case. I see an empty wong standing over zere
near ze hatchway. Can I buy him from you?"</p>

<p>"I'll make you a present of the big case, and be glad to
get rid of it, as it takes up valuable space," replied Mr.
Reynard, pleasantly. "Come, I'll help you to get it downstairs
to your floor by means of the fall."</p>

<p>He opened the hatchway while La Croix was profusely
thanking him, put a sling around the box and lowered it.</p>

<p>La Croix pulled the box into his front room through a
door in the partition which surrounded the hatchway.</p>

<p>This done and Reynard out of the way, the smuggler
turned to his wife, pointed at the box and asked her, with
a grim smile:</p>

<p>"You know what zat ees for, my dear?"</p>

<p>"No. I have no idea. What?"</p>

<p>"To pack ze detectives in."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"So I can ship zem away."</p>

<p>"Won't it kill them?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied, indifferently, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well," she remarked, after a moment's reflection, "it
will give us time to get away to Canada without them
knowing our destination."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> Zat ees my object."</p>

<p>He was provided with a hammer and some nails, and
taking the lid off the box, he saw that it was amply big to
hold the detectives' bodies.</p>

<p>Some of the joints were shrunk open, he noticed, which
would admit air for the officers to breathe. This would keep
them alive some time if they were not killed some other way
in transit.</p>

<p>He did not care much about that, however.</p>

<p>Calling his wife to aid him, he went into the next room
where the two bound and gagged detectives laid upon the
floor side by side.</p>

<p>Neither could move or speak.</p>

<p>They were wondering what their fate was to be.</p>

<p>It filled them with chagrin to reflect that this Frenchman
had alone overpowered them without the slightest trouble.</p>

<p>La Croix seized Old King Brady first and dragged him
into the next room.</p>

<p>"Now, Lena," he remarked, "help me to leeft him in ze
box."</p>

<p>He took the detective by the head and she grasped his
ankles and they quickly dropped their prisoner in the case.</p>

<p>Harry was served the same way.</p>

<p>There was just room enough to hold them.</p>

<p>When La Croix nailed on the lid, they realized what he
intended to do with them and it made them feel very downhearted.</p>

<p>"Going to ship us away," thought Old King Brady.</p>

<p>La Croix then borrowed Reynard's brush and marking
pot and they heard him chuckle and say to his wife:</p>

<p>"I weel direct ze box to wong fictitious address in Sacramento,
California. By ze time ze secret police arrive zere,
<i>par Dieu</i>, zey weel be zez dead mans!"</p>

<p>He then addressed the case and went after a truckman.</p>

<p>This done, between them they lowered the case through
the hatchway into the street, and it was banged with a hook,
turned over and over and pushed up a pair of rungs on the
truck.</p>

<p>The Bradys were badly bumped and bruised.</p>

<p>But being gagged they had to suffer in silence.</p>

<p>Finally the truck was driven away with them, and reaching
the Erie freight depot, the driver got a receipt for the
box and dumped it off his truck.</p>

<p>The shock upon the imprisoned detectives was awful.</p>

<p>They heard the driver say:</p>

<p>"Collect de charges. Dat box goes via Buffalo, don't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the freight agent.</p>

<p>"Well, yer'd better handle it wid care, as I tink it's got
artificial flowers in it, an' yer might smash de stuffins out
o' dem."</p>

<p>"Mighty heavy artificial flowers," growled the agent.</p>

<p>Then the truck drove away.</p>

<p>The detectives laid in the freight building for some time,
and the interior of the box became hot and stifling.</p>

<p>Fortunately the box stood as they were lying on their
sides.</p>

<p>About noontime their troubles began again, for the
freight handlers got hold of the box to send it over the river
to Jersey with other freight. The detectives were tumbled
and slammed about roughly, at one moment resting on their
heads, at another on their faces, then they were picked up
by a hand-truck and banged upon their backs on the boat.
For a while they had a rest.</p>

<p>No one heard the groans of pain they uttered as they
were bumped, bruised and cut, and they were carried over
the river.</p>

<p>Here the rough handling began again until they were
laden on a freight car due to go out that night.</p>

<p>The box now rested so that they were standing up.</p>

<p>It was such a painful attitude in those cramped quarters
that they were in misery, for they were face to face, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>their bodies bent over on account of the box being too short
for the length of their bodies.</p>

<p>Both had made the most desperate efforts to get rid of
their bonds and gags, but found it impossible to do so.</p>

<p>Some hours later they felt the train get in motion and
knew they were on their way to Buffalo.</p>

<p>The time dragged very slowly.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed by and the night passed and
another day came.</p>

<p>Hunger and thirst were now added to the miseries they
already endured and the strain they were under brought
them to the verge of fainting.</p>

<p>Toward noontime the train paused at a way station to
take on some freight and the box in which the detectives
were packed was thrown over to make room for it.</p>

<p>As it struck the floor, Old King Brady struck his face
forcibly against the side of the box and made his nose
bleed.</p>

<p>He gave a deep groan and one of the freight handlers
heard it.</p>

<p>"Good Lor'!" he exclaimed in startled tones, as he glared
around. "What's that? Sounded like a man's voice."</p>

<p>Another groan from the old detective attracted his attention
to the packing case, and he saw a tiny stream of blood
trickling out of it through one of the cracks, upon the floor.</p>

<p>A thrill of horror darted through the man.</p>

<p>He began to suspect a corpse was in the box, and visions
of a dreadful murder mystery floated through his mind.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom! Hey, Bill! Come here, quick!" he yelled
at his companions.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Bring a hammer here!"</p>

<p>"Did you bust open a box?"</p>

<p>"No. But I'm going to."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I heard a man groaning in that&mdash;ha! Hear it?"</p>

<p>A third groan from Old King Brady reached their ears
and seeing the blood, they quickly realized that there was
some one in the case.</p>

<p>Procuring a hammer, they pulled off the lid.</p>

<p>The two detectives were revealed.</p>

<p>Harry was senseless.</p>

<p>Cries of astonishment escaped the men, and observing
that the pair were still alive, they pulled them out of the
box and laid them on the floor.</p>

<p>Removing the gags and bonds, the trainmen brought
water and bathed the bruised and swollen faces of the detectives.</p>

<p>This treatment revived Harry.</p>

<p>Both were very weak, and they ached all over.</p>

<p>"Give us a drink," Old King Brady implored.</p>

<p>When this was done they asked for something to eat.</p>

<p>The trainmen got some food at the station and a big
crowd gathered round when the news spread.</p>

<p>After eating and drinking and rubbing their legs and
arms, the Bradys recovered rapidly and told who they were
and what befell them.</p>

<p>In a short time they were able to walk.</p>

<p>"Are you going back to New York to arrest the rascal
who did this?" asked the man who discovered them.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" replied Harry, quickly. "We wouldn't
find them there if we did. They are probably on their
way to Canada now."</p>

<p>"Going after them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better stay with us until we arrive in
Buffalo and you won't have so far to go to reach Montreal."</p>

<p>"We'll do that," said Old King Brady. "But don't let
on about our escape. If the newspapers get hold of the
story and publish it, our enemy may learn how we baffled
his design and he will be on his guard against an attack
from us."</p>

<p>"I'll keep mum, Mr. Brady. We'll reach Buffalo to-night
and you can then attend properly to your injuries."</p>

<p>The train then moved on, and the detectives finally
reached their destination and put up in a hotel, where a
physician attended to their injuries.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>A MYSTERIOUS WOMAN IN BLACK.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Old King Brady, your life is in danger."</p>

<p>"From what?"</p>

<p>"The man you are persecuting."</p>

<p>"You mean Paul La Croix, I presume?"</p>

<p>"I do. Go back to New York at once."</p>

<p>"Madam, I shall do nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>"Then you must suffer for your obstinacy."</p>

<p>"I am prepared for anything, madam."</p>

<p>"Remember, I have given you fair warning. You cannot
arrest La Croix on Canadian soil for smuggling."</p>

<p>And the veiled woman in deep mourning, who accosted
the old detective in a dark street in Toronto, turned as if to
walk away.</p>

<p>This happened several weeks after the Bradys reached
Buffalo.</p>

<p>They had been vainly searching for La Croix and his
wife.</p>

<p>On the night in question, Old King Brady had gone out
from his hotel alone, when the woman in mourning met him
in the street.</p>

<p>The light of a street lamp fell upon them.</p>

<p>She gave a slight start and began to follow him.</p>

<p>When he discovered this and turned around, asking why
she was dogging his footsteps, she gave the above recorded
answer.</p>

<p>By her mentioning his name, he realized that she knew
him, and he at once suspected she was La Croix's wife.</p>

<p>He resolved to fathom the mystery of her identity.</p>

<p>Seizing her arm, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hold on a moment."</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked, pausing obediently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>"I want to know who you are that takes such a deep
interest in my welfare. I want to know who it is that knows
me&mdash;who knows all about the private business which has
brought me to this city. Speak out. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Your friend," replied the mysterious unknown.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"I must decline to tell you."</p>

<p>"But I won't take a refusal. You must speak."</p>

<p>"No. Allow me to retain my incognito. It were best for
us both."</p>

<p>Old King Brady was determined to know her, however,
and he seized her long crepe veil and attempted to remove
it from her face.</p>

<p>A subdued cry of anger escaped her.</p>

<p>"Let that be!" she exclaimed, imperiously.</p>

<p>"Madam, I must see who you are!" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Is this the gratitude you show for the favor I have
done you?"</p>

<p>"You have aroused my curiosity."</p>

<p>"Stand back, sir. Don't you dare lay a hand on me
again."</p>

<p>"Why," he laughed, "is it dangerous?"</p>

<p>"Very!"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>She drew a slender dagger from the folds of her dark
dress, and as the lamplight glanced upon the blade, it
flashed as she drew it back.</p>

<p>Old King Brady was startled.</p>

<p>He did not expect to see anything like this.</p>

<p>Raising the dagger, the mysterious woman hissed:</p>

<p>"If you attempt to penetrate my identity, I shall stab
you!"</p>

<p>There was a ring of intense earnestness to her voice,
and it froze the smile that rose to the old detective's face.</p>

<p>He regarded her with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>It now began to dawn upon his mind that she was not
Mrs. La Croix after all. The voice was different. She
was shorter and stouter than the smuggler's wife. Her
actions were different.</p>

<p>To gain time to form a different tactic he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How can you be a friend of mine if you are going to
stab me?"</p>

<p>"I am bound to keep my identity a secret," she replied,
firmly.</p>

<p>"What object have you in befriending me?"</p>

<p>"You are a brave man and a dutiful officer. I know you
are only following up this case because you were ordered
to do so. I therefore don't wish to see you perish."</p>

<p>"How do you know I'm doomed to get killed?"</p>

<p>"Because I heard your enemies plot your destruction."</p>

<p>"In that case they know we are here on their trail?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Every move you make is being keenly watched by
spies."</p>

<p>"Our enemies must be well-disguised and keep well under
cover."</p>

<p>"You haven't thus far detected them, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"Then that shows how secure they are. A number of
times they have been as close to you as I am. Yet you did
not know it. By this you can realize how easy it would be
for them to attack you unexpectedly, kill you, and escape."</p>

<p>"Even that thought won't scare me off the case."</p>

<p>"You are very obstinate and persevering."</p>

<p>"Those two elements will yet make me win this fight."</p>

<p>"Foolish man. Don't delude yourself. Your enemies
are very powerful people. They will beat you in the end."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with your idea."</p>

<p>"Is my warning in vain?"</p>

<p>"Entirely so."</p>

<p>The veiled woman sighed and bowed her head in thought.
Finally she strode away, saying in impatient tones:</p>

<p>"Very well. Since I can't dissuade you from your set
purpose, I shall not bother myself any further about the
matter."</p>

<p>She seemed to be very angry at the old detective.</p>

<p>He strode after her.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment longer!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No. I have no more to say," she replied, sharply.
"Don't attempt to follow me. If you do, it will be as much
as your life is worth."</p>

<p>"Humbug!" he replied.</p>

<p>"So you doubt me, eh? Well, look behind you."</p>

<p>He glanced over his shoulder and caught view of the
shadowy figures of several men lurking about the trees
lining the street.</p>

<p>Old King Brady was astonished.</p>

<p>She evidently had a body-guard of watchful men.</p>

<p>"Who are those people?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"My friends," she replied, quietly. "If they saw you
attack or follow me, they would put a sudden end to your
career at long range."</p>

<p>"By firing?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Let me walk as far as the corner with you."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Brady. I have no objection to that."</p>

<p>The journey was made in utter silence, and the old
detective noticed that the shadowy men were following
them.</p>

<p>When they reached the corner, Old King Brady glanced
around, looking for Harry, who agreed to meet him there.</p>

<p>The boy was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>Old King Brady then coughed and dropped his handkerchief
as a signal.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no notice paid to it, but presently
he heard a distant hissing sound of singular penetration.</p>

<p>It was an answer to his signal and meant that he was
seen and understood.</p>

<p>With a satisfied feeling the old detective now said to
the veiled woman:</p>

<p>"I shall leave you here. Don't think I am ungrateful for
your kindness. On the contrary, I appreciate it very much.
But my duty compels me to pay no heed to your valuable
warning. I must run down my quarry. Good-night,
madam."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>"Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>He tipped his hat and strode away to the Walker House,
where he was staying.</p>

<p>She stood watching him until he was several blocks
distant and then gave vent to a low, peculiar whistle.</p>

<p>Instantly four men came gliding from the shadows, and
grouped around her, as she started to walk away.</p>

<p>She was heading for the railroad depot.</p>

<p>When she was gone, Harry Brady slid down from the
dense foliage of a nearby tree where he had been a hidden
watcher.</p>

<p>The boy had seen the woman and her body-guard, and
knew that his partner wanted him to shadow her from that
point.</p>

<p>Accordingly he glided along after them.</p>

<p>Dodging from tree to tree, slinking along in the densest
shadows and never exposing himself for an instant in a
ray of light which would betray him, Harry dogged them
to the railroad station.</p>

<p>He saw them purchase tickets and board a train.</p>

<p>Gliding over to the ticket office he asked the agent:</p>

<p>"Where did those five people buy tickets for?"</p>

<p>"Montreal," replied the man, "on the Grand Trunk
road."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Harry, politely.</p>

<p>And the boy ran behind a freight car to shelter him from
the gaze of the passengers in the waiting train.</p>

<p>Finding an opening between two of the cars he peered
through.</p>

<p>Directly opposite him sat the woman in black, with two
of her male companions in the seat ahead and two behind
her.</p>

<p>She was close to the window.</p>

<p>Just then she drew her veil aside and Harry saw her face.</p>

<p>A startled cry escaped the boy.</p>

<p>"By jove!" he gasped. "She's Clara La Croix, the girl
smuggler!"</p>

<p>And so she was!</p>

<h3>GAINING A FEW POINTS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Young King Brady, of course, knew nothing about the
dialogue which passed between his partner and the girl.
But he felt pretty confident that Old King Brady did not
know who the girl was.</p>

<p>Without the slightest hesitation Harry made his way
unseen to the rear car, and boarded the train just as it
pulled out of the station.</p>

<p>The boy wore a bicycle suit and a false beard.</p>

<p>He felt pretty sure he would not be known in this outfit,
and passing inside the car, he took a seat.</p>

<p>The distance between Toronto and Montreal was about
350 miles along the Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence
river.</p>

<p>"I don't believe La Croix or his wife are in Toronto,"
the boy muttered, "for we've gone over the city with a
fine-toothed comb, and failed to find the slightest sign of
them. They must be either in Montreal or Quebec, for the
girl is going to the former place. Miss Clara made a quick
trip. She could not have been here long from Holland.
And I presume she is laden with those diamonds she went
after. La Croix is now doubtless scheming to smuggle
them over the border into the United States. We've got
to watch these people closely now. That Frenchman is a
desperate man. We have seen that he would not stop at
murder to attain his purposes. When I reach Montreal, I
must telegraph Old King Brady to come on and meet me.
He will be wondering what has become of me now."</p>

<p>When the conductor came through, Harry paid his fare
in cash.</p>

<p>A short time afterward one of the girl's male companions
made a trip from one end of the train to the other.</p>

<p>He sharply eyed every passenger on the cars and favored
Harry with a particularly keen and searching stare.</p>

<p>It made the boy imagine for an instant that his identity
was known, but he never flinched.</p>

<p>The man passed on, however, without making any remark.</p>

<p>It took fifteen hours to make the run, and it was three
o'clock on the following afternoon before the train pulled
into Montreal.</p>

<p>Shadowing the girl smuggler and her companions, Harry
saw them go to a hotel, where the men left her.</p>

<p>While they went down to the Dominion Line dock, the
girl passed into the hotel and Harry saw her go upstairs.</p>

<p>The hotel clerk, a dudish young fellow, was staring after
her when Harry approached him and said:</p>

<p>"Deuced pretty girl that."</p>

<p>"Very," assented the clerk. "A widow, too!"</p>

<p>"Rather young to be a widow, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Marie P. Savoy."</p>

<p>"Been here long?"</p>

<p>"A week."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"She came in on the steamer Dominion from Havre
alone, but her mother and father soon joined her here.
She went down to Toronto a few days ago leaving the old
folks here. She's just returned."</p>

<p>"I see. I'd like to get acquainted with her."</p>

<p>"You may if you stop here."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm going to do. Give me a good room."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. Got any baggage?"</p>

<p>"None, whatever. I came from Niagara in a hurry."</p>

<p>"You can have No. 37. That's right next to the one
occupied by the beautiful young widow. Perhaps it may
lead to your becoming acquainted with her as you wish."</p>

<p>"I hope so," laughed Harry, who was delighted at his
good luck. "Got a telegraph station here?"</p>

<p>"No. But there's one across the street."</p>

<p>Harry went out and telegraphed to Old King Brady to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>come and meet him in Montreal and then went to his
room.</p>

<p>While washing, he heard the hum of voices in Clara La
Croix's room, and gliding over to the wall, pressed his ear
against the partition.</p>

<p>It was a hollow wall and nearly every word was quite
audible.</p>

<p>The first thing he heard was a man's voice which he did
not recognize, but presumed was La Croix, asking:</p>

<p>"Well, how did you make out in Toronto, Clara?"</p>

<p>"All right," the girl replied. "I found your four spies
there. They report that the Custom House inspectors at
Niagara Falls are on the alert. There has been a shaking
up of the department. The Collector of the Port of New
York is dissatisfied with the amount of smuggling that is
being carried on, and made it very hot for everybody."</p>

<p>"That ees bad for us."</p>

<p>"Very. We'll either have to keep shady a while or play
a trick on them to pass the diamonds I brought over from
Holland. As there are $250,000 worth of the gems, you
can't afford to have them seized for duty and run chances
on going to prison for the job, papa."</p>

<p>"That ees a fact. It would ruin me. I'll have to think
of some&mdash;vat you call&mdash;plan to beat ze Custom House."</p>

<p>"I've got some bad news for you, too."</p>

<p>"Vat ees zat?" asked La Croix, nervously.</p>

<p>"The Bradys are in Toronto looking for you."</p>

<p>The smuggler started as if he were stung and turned
deathly pale.</p>

<p>A look of blank dismay settled upon his sallow face, his
dark eyes sparkled angrily and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> I thought zey was done for!"</p>

<p>"You told me how you had shipped them in a box."</p>

<p>"Zen zey have escape, eh?"</p>

<p>"So it seems. One of your men discovered them. Before
I came here, I met Old King Brady in the street and
warned him of the danger of following you up. He refused
to quit."</p>

<p>"Zat man ees a demon! I weel keel heem yet!" raved La
Croix.</p>

<p>"Look out he don't kill you," replied his daughter.</p>

<p>"What wiz him deed you do?"</p>

<p>"Left him in Toronto."</p>

<p>"An' he not know we ees here?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm sure he don't."</p>

<p>"But eet puzzle me to know how he learn we ees in
Canada."</p>

<p>"He may have had some method of finding out those
things."</p>

<p>"I wondair how from ze box zey escape?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know."</p>

<p>"Where ees ze four men?"</p>

<p>"Gone down to the steamship dock for my trunk."</p>

<p>"Zen zey come back here soon, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I presumed you wished to consult with them and
therefore ordered them to report here to you."</p>

<p>"So I do. Ve must vatch for ze detectives ver' sharp
now."</p>

<p>"Where is mother?"</p>

<p>"Een my room."</p>

<p>"I'll go in and see her. I'm going to get rid of these
uncomfortable widow's weeds. They were all very well as a
disguise in which to travel in Europe and come back here,
but I am heartily sick of wearing them. They make me feel
so old."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself, my dear."</p>

<p>The girl then left her room and as there was no more to
hear, Harry resumed his ablutions and put on his false
beard again.</p>

<p>He kept a strict watch upon the smuggler all that day and
saw La Croix hold a meeting with his spies in his own
room.</p>

<p>The boy failed to overhear what they had to say, but
that did not worry him, as long as he had his quarry under
observation.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon an old farmer with a homespun
suit, an old felt hat, and gray whiskers, arrived at
the hotel.</p>

<p>Harry was standing in the lobby when he came in and
recognized him at once as Old King Brady, but made no
sign.</p>

<p>The old detective recognized the boy at the same moment,
and calling for a room, he seized his carpet bag and umbrella,
and followed the bell-boy upstairs.</p>

<p>Harry considered it safest to keep apart from his partner
in public, and for that reason failed to speak to him.</p>

<p>When he afterward learned which room Old King Brady
occupied, he quietly went up there and was admitted.</p>

<p>In whispers they explained to each other all that transpired
and the old detective was delighted over the boy's
success.</p>

<p>"So the mysterious woman in black was the girl smuggler,
eh?" asked the old detective. "Well, I'm surprised."</p>

<p>"Her warning you, shows that she has some regard for
us and don't wish to see us come to grief," replied Harry,
sentimentally.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, it may have been a diplomatic move
on her part to bluff us off until they smuggle that big consignment
of diamonds over the border," replied Old King
Brady, practically.</p>

<p>"Well, she didn't succeed."</p>

<p>"By no means."</p>

<p>"Have you formed any plan of action?"</p>

<p>"Only one."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"To catch them smuggling those diamonds and arrest
them with the evidence in their possession, which will send
them to prison for many years," replied Old King Brady.</p>

<h3>CROSSING THE BORDER.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>As La Croix's party did not seem to be in any hurry to
leave Montreal, the Bradys had plenty of time to arrange
their plans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>On the following day they went to the telegraph office
and sent two messages, the first being couched in the following
terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Collector of Port, N.Y.: Swear out warrant for arrest
of Clara La Croix, charge of smuggling, and mail at once
to International, Niagara Falls. Brady."</p></div>

<p>The second was addressed to the Customs department at
Suspension Bridge, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Keep watch for La Croix, wife and daughter with four
spies. Are going to attempt to pass $250,000 worth of
diamonds."</p></div>

<p>As La Croix was well known, details were useless.</p>

<p>The Bradys watched their quarry closely.</p>

<p>Knowing they had those diamonds with them, and that
they would very likely play a sharp trick to evade the
inspectors, the Bradys were very careful.</p>

<p>Scarcely a move made by the family escaped them.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent to the detectives that an important
move was soon to be made, for the four spies were
in frequent consultation with the Frenchman and his
family.</p>

<p>"They are evidently arranging a plan of action," Harry
commented, as he and his partner traced the men to La
Croix's room for the fourth time.</p>

<p>"I wish there was some way of getting a clew to their
design," Old King Brady replied, in wistful tones. "We
are completely in the dark."</p>

<p>"That's a sheer impossibility," Harry answered. "They
are taking the most extraordinary care not to let anyone
hear a word they are saying or see a thing they are doing.
I've tried several times, and failed."</p>

<p>"We've got a sharp gang to deal with, my boy. And
the worst of it is that $250,000 worth of diamonds makes
such a small package that they won't have the slightest
trouble to conceal it."</p>

<p>"As they are not likely to allow so valuable a parcel to
leave their hands, by arresting the whole gang the moment
they reach the American side, we are likely to find the
jewels on the person of one or the other."</p>

<p>"And I quite agree with that plan," said Harry. "In
fact, it's the only safe method of securing them for a certainty."</p>

<p>"Have you noticed whether they made friends with any
outsiders here?"</p>

<p>"No, they haven't. They keep strictly aloof from everybody.
I made an attempt to speak to each one of the
party in a friendly way at the table, but they gave me such
a cold reception, I had to withdraw in a hurry."</p>

<p>That day, La Croix and his party left Montreal.</p>

<p>Boarding a train for Toronto, they went away.</p>

<p>The Bradys were on the same train.</p>

<p>Once more their disguises were changed, for they did
not want the smugglers to see them in Toronto in the same
characters, as it might arouse their suspicions.</p>

<p>They were now rigged out as two regular army soldiers,
and pretended to be sightseeing, as most Americans are up
in that region.</p>

<p>La Croix and his party only remained a day in Toronto.</p>

<p>The detectives now discovered that two of the spies had
disappeared and a swift search was made to find them.</p>

<p>Harry did the investigating.</p>

<p>He finally discovered that one of them had gone to get
married, and the other acted as best man at the ceremony.</p>

<p>The spy married a pretty French-Canadian girl.</p>

<p>His companion returned to La Croix's party and the
bride and groom started off on a short wedding trip.</p>

<p>Young King Brady dropped them.</p>

<p>"They'll be so busy spooning and lally-gagging that he
won't have any time to attend to this smuggling game,"
thought the boy detective, as he went back to his partner
to report the occurrence.</p>

<p>Old King Brady was watching the Frenchman's party.</p>

<p>Next day the smugglers boarded the cars for Niagara,
and the Bradys felt that their work would soon be at an
end.</p>

<p>As the Custom House officers of Niagara had been
specially warned against these people, they made a very
careful search of their baggage and persons.</p>

<p>Every one underwent a most rigid examination.</p>

<p>Not a thing or place was overlooked in which there was
the faintest chance of concealing precious stones.</p>

<p>But despite the keenness of the scrutiny&mdash;despite the extraordinary
watchfulness&mdash;despite every care&mdash;not a diamond
was found.</p>

<p>The Bradys looked on eagerly.</p>

<p>Each one expected a remarkable disclosure.</p>

<p>But when they saw the officers baffled, it worried them.</p>

<p>They could not understand this want of success, except
by thinking that the La Croix party were playing some
deep, shrewd game.</p>

<p>The Frenchman laughed sardonically at the officers and
said:</p>

<p>"Ah, Messieurs, zis ees ze time I fool you! <i>Comprong?</i>"</p>

<p>"If any of your party have anything contraband," grimly
answered the officer, in disappointed tones, "you must have
swallowed it."</p>

<p>"Zen why you not examine us wiz ze X-ray?" chuckled
La Croix.</p>

<p>"I'd like to take you at your invitation, you are such a
slippery customer," growled the officer, who had had some
experience with him before.</p>

<p>The party were permitted to go.</p>

<p>They headed for the International hotel and as the
Bradys had already arranged to go there, they followed the
Frenchman's party.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the officers, a legal envelope was
handed to Old King Brady, and he opened it and withdrew
a warrant for Clara La Croix.</p>

<p>"No need of this, yet," he grumbled, holding it up.</p>

<p>"We may want it very soon," replied Harry. "They had
the diamonds, and if they've eluded our vigilance, or given
them to anyone else to smuggle over, they'll have to get the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>jewels away from the smuggler and that will be the time
for us to grab them."</p>

<p>Several days passed by, during which La Croix's three
spies returned to Canada, as they were then of no further
service.</p>

<p>The day after they had gone, the fourth spy, who had
got married, suddenly came over from Canada with his
bride, and the detectives saw them go to the hotel where the
La Croix party was stopping.</p>

<p>With their suspicions aroused, the Bradys watched them.</p>

<p>They went up to the clerk, sent their card to La Croix's
room, and Clara presently came down and greeted them
warmly.</p>

<p>"Papa is shaving," she remarked. "Can't you come to
my room? I'll try to entertain you until he is disengaged."</p>

<p>She had abandoned her widow's weeds and resumed her
wonted attire in which she looked very young and charming.</p>

<p>The bride smiled, patted her on the head and said:</p>

<p>"I like you. Nothing would please me better."</p>

<p>The moment she assented, the Bradys hastened upstairs.</p>

<p>Clara's room was open and they entered and glanced
around.</p>

<p>It was a magnificently-furnished apartment and the
trunk she brought over from France stood in the middle of
the room.</p>

<p>At one side was a closet.</p>

<p>The Bradys dodged into it and closed the door.</p>

<p>No sooner were they concealed when Clara and her two
guests came in and at her invitation, seated themselves.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the girl smuggler, in eager tones, "how did
you make out?"</p>

<p>"Fine," laughed the spy, producing a package from his
pocket. "We kept the diamonds and remained in Canada,
spending our honeymoon. When we started for the American
side, my wife had the package of diamonds fastened
under the lining of her skirt. No one suspected us, of
course. The officers only made a careless examination of
our satchel and valise. We had no trouble whatever."</p>

<p>"How lucky!"</p>

<p>"Is there any use for us to remain here to see your
father? We are in a hurry, and can come back in the course
of an hour."</p>

<p>"That will do."</p>

<p>"We will go, then."</p>

<p>And they left the room.</p>

<p>A few moments later there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," cried the girl.</p>

<p>Her mother entered the room.</p>

<p>"Where are the bridal couple, Clara?" she asked, glancing
around.</p>

<p>"Just gone. They'll return in an hour."</p>

<p>"Did they leave the package of diamonds?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And here it is."</p>

<p>Another knock came at the door.</p>

<p>"Hide the parcel!" gasped Mrs. La Croix, nervously.</p>

<p>The girl thrust it in her pocket.</p>

<p>"Enter!" she cried.</p>

<p>The door opened and a hall-boy came in.</p>

<p>"Did you ring, Miss La Croix?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "I want you to do something for
me."</p>

<p>Rising to her feet she drew the boy aside and held a
whispered talk with him for several moments.</p>

<p>In the course of their conversation he said to her:</p>

<p>"I saw two men enter this room just before you came in
with that lady and gentleman, and they didn't go out
again, either."</p>

<p>The girl looked startled.</p>

<p>She spoke to him rapidly a moment, and he started for
the door.</p>

<p>Before he could depart, however, the closet door flew
open with a bang and the Bradys sprang from their place
of concealment.</p>

<p>"Hold on, there!" cried Harry. "Let no one leave this
room!"</p>

<p>The hall-boy paused, an alarmed look on his face.</p>

<h3>SERVING THE WARRANT.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Mrs. La Croix and her daughter were possessed of good
nerves, for the dramatic entrance of the Bradys did not
seem to startle them in the least.</p>

<p>They glanced coolly at the detectives and Mrs. La Croix
asked, haughtily:</p>

<p>"Who are these men?"</p>

<p>"Detectives, madam," replied Old King Brady, politely.</p>

<p>"Indeed! What were you sneaking in that closet for?"</p>

<p>"To learn the true inwardness of your gigantic smuggling
scheme."</p>

<p>"You must be mad."</p>

<p>"No, indeed. We are quite sane, I assure you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by our smuggling?"</p>

<p>"Simply this: We know all about your daughter's trip
to Holland and we've been watching her since she landed
at Montreal."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the lady, icily, "you have, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want, now?"</p>

<p><a name="IMAGE_1_CAPTION" id="IMAGE_1_CAPTION"></a>
"Madam," said Old King Brady, "here is a warrant for
the arrest of your daughter. The charge is smuggling!"</p>

<p>Calmly taking the document, the lady read it.</p>

<p>Harry opened the door and let the hall-boy go.</p>

<p>The young detective did not want the boy to hear all
that transpired and the hall-boy hastened away.</p>

<p>Rushing to Paul La Croix's room, he pounded on the
door, entered and found the smuggler shaving himself.</p>

<p>"There's two detectives in your daughter's room!" he
gasped.</p>

<p>"<i>Sacre!</i>" roared La Croix in startled tones.</p>

<p>"They've got a warrant for your daughter's arrest."</p>

<p>"Who zey are?" groaned La Croix.</p>

<p>"The Bradys."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>"We are lost!"</p>

<p>"Your daughter slipped me this package and told me to
give it to you."</p>

<p>He handed over the parcel of diamonds, and with a glad
cry, La Croix eagerly seized it and thrust it in the bosom
of his shirt.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;five dollaire for you!" he panted, giving the boy
a bill. "Keep ze still tongue about our affairs. Now go!"</p>

<p>The boy shot out of the room and the man wrote a note
and left it on the bureau.</p>

<p>La Croix hastily dressed and rushed out of the hotel.</p>

<p>He was fearfully excited.</p>

<p>Reaching the street, he called a cab, doubled the driver's
fare and was driven furiously to the railroad depot.</p>

<p>Here he caught a departing train.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Bradys imagined they had Clara La
Croix with the package of diamonds in her possession.</p>

<p>Harry placed his hand on the girl smuggler's arm.</p>

<p>"I hate to do it, Miss," said he, half apologetically, "but
you are my prisoner."</p>

<p>She took her arrest with exasperating coolness.</p>

<p>Smiling up at him, she said in low, sweet tones:</p>

<p>"I'm charged with smuggling, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"About $250,000 worth of diamonds."</p>

<p>"How ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. We've got all the facts."</p>

<p>"Please name them."</p>

<p>"You went to Amsterdam and came back on the Dominion
with the jewels I mentioned. In Toronto you gave
them to one of your father's spies who got married. Your
party crossed the border and were searched. Of course, no
jewels were found on you. A short time ago the spy and
his bride followed you; they smuggled the diamonds over
the Suspension Bridge for you. A few minutes ago they
were here and delivered the package to you. You've got it
now, so hand it over."</p>

<p>"I haven't got any package of diamonds," protested the
girl.</p>

<p>"Now, don't try to lie out of it. We've got the evidence
against you which you can't deny. Be sensible and save
yourself further trouble by handing over the gems. If you
don't we'll take them by force."</p>

<p>"I am telling you the truth."</p>

<p>"Further concealment is useless."</p>

<p>"Then search us and convince yourself."</p>

<p>Harry accepted her offer and failed to find the stones.</p>

<p>While he was so employed, Old King Brady searched her
mother with equal non-success, and a surprised look spread
over their faces.</p>

<p>"The girl hasn't got them!" exclaimed Harry, in disgust.</p>

<p>"Nor has her mother," added Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"They must have hidden them."</p>

<p>"Search the room."</p>

<p>"Don't move, ladies, or we'll handcuff you."</p>

<p>"No need of that ignominy," said the girl.</p>

<p>They made a thorough and painstaking search of the
place, but failed to meet with any success and finally gave
it up.</p>

<p>The diamonds remained missing.</p>

<p>Both were greatly puzzled.</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea occurred to Harry and he cried:</p>

<p>"The hall-boy!"</p>

<p>"What about him?" asked his partner.</p>

<p>"He may have carried off the parcel."</p>

<p>"See!"</p>

<p>"You guard them."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Harry rushed out of the room.</p>

<p>Finding the boy down in the office, Harry seized him.</p>

<p>"Where did you put the package that girl gave you?"
he roared.</p>

<p>The boy turned pale with fright, and a panic seized him
as he suddenly thought his share in the matter was known.</p>

<p>With bulging eyes and chattering teeth, he gasped:</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake don't arrest me, and I'll tell you, sir."</p>

<p>"Well? Speak out&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>"The young lady told me to give it to her father."</p>

<p>"And you did?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."'</p>

<p>"Where was he?"</p>

<p>"In his room."</p>

<p>"Is he there yet?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Harry rushed upstairs again.</p>

<p>Pushing open the door of Paul La Croix's room he entered.</p>

<p>None of the man's possessions was disturbed, but Harry
caught view of the note he had written and placed on his
bureau.</p>

<p>The boy picked it up and read the following lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Monsieur Brady: By the time you get this letter I will
be far away. You are duped. Do as you please with my innocent
wife and daughter. You can prove nothing against
them. An outsider did the smuggling. That lets us out. I
defy you. Do your worst. La Croix."</p></div>

<p>Young King Brady smiled at the note.</p>

<p>"The raving of a madman!" he muttered scornfully.
"If he imagines he has beaten us, we will soon relieve him
of that notion."</p>

<p>He carried the note to Old King Brady and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"La Croix has escaped with the diamonds."</p>

<p>"How did he get them?" asked the old detective, curiously.</p>

<p>"Clara sent them to him by the hall-boy."</p>

<p>"As I feared!"</p>

<p>"We can't convict these women."</p>

<p>"No. Release them."</p>

<p>"Ladies, you are free."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Clara, with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"Go your way. We can't secure anything but revenge
by prosecuting you, and that isn't what we are after. I
must say, though, Mrs. La Croix, that was an inhuman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>thing for you and your husband to do, boxing us up and
shipping us to California. We are more merciful to you
when it lies in our power to put you in prison."</p>

<p>The woman's face reddened with shame.</p>

<p>She hung her head, but made no reply.</p>

<p>Old King Brady then said to Harry in hurried tones:</p>

<p>"Come. We must get on La Croix's trail. We'll run him
down if it takes a year to do it!"</p>

<p>They rushed from the room.</p>

<p>Harry, however, paused outside the door and listened.</p>

<p>The woman and her daughter uttered a merry peal of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Good for papa!" cried the girl. "He'll save the gems
yet."</p>

<p>"Those detectives have gone on a wild goose chase," contemptuously
replied her mother. "Paul will outwit them.
To-morrow you and I will go back to New York, and put
up at the Waldorf. When your father has safely disposed
of those gems he will go there to look for us. It's a
rendezvous we had arranged beforehand in case trouble
came up."</p>

<p>Harry nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>"Glad you've posted me," he muttered. "I won't lose
sight of you two charming creatures. It wasn't good policy
to pull you in without the diamonds if you only knew it,
and that's the only reason you are at liberty now. We'll
play with you as a cat plays with a mouse."</p>

<p>And he walked away from the door feeling well satisfied
with the shape the case was taking.</p>

<h3>SUBDUING A TARTAR.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Old King Brady had gone ahead in an effort to find
out what had become of Paul La Croix.</p>

<p>Reaching the street he accosted a man at the door with
the question:</p>

<p>"Did you see a thin man with a black moustache, a high
hat, and frock coat come out of here in a hurry a few
moments ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He got in a cab and rode away."</p>

<p>"Did you notice the sort of cab it was?"</p>

<p>"I did. Do you know Pork Chops, the negro hackman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, it was his rig."</p>

<p>"Which way did they go?"</p>

<p>"In the direction of the railroad depot."</p>

<p>Thanking his informant, the old detective hastened away
convinced that the fugitive was going out of Niagara by
rail.</p>

<p>When he reached the depot he described La Croix and
asked where he had gone.</p>

<p>"That's none of your business," growled the surly
ticket agent.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it?" queried the detective, blandly.</p>

<p>"No!" shouted the man, "and I'll not tell you."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't hurt you to be polite and accommodating,
would it?"</p>

<p>"I ain't here to keep inquisitive people posted about our
passengers."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," assented Old King Brady, "but I have
an urgent reason for wishing to know where that man
went."</p>

<p>"I don't care anything about your private reasons. If
you don't want to buy a ticket, get away from that window
and don't annoy me."</p>

<p>"Very well," meekly answered the detective.</p>

<p>He thereupon stepped through the door into the agent's
office, and the man scowled, and glared at him and roared:</p>

<p>"What in thunder do you want in here, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I've come in to arrest you," quietly answered the old
detective, as he showed his badge. "I'm a detective, as you
can plainly see, and the man I inquired about is a fugitive
smuggler. As you are aiding him to escape, by withholding
the information I want, you must be an accessory of
his. As such, you'll have to go to jail!"</p>

<p>The man wilted.</p>

<p>All his lordly, overbearing manners vanished.</p>

<p>Turning as pale as death and trembling like an aspen,
he gasped tremulously:</p>

<p>"For pity's sake don't lock me up. I didn't know the circumstances."</p>

<p>"You're an unmannerly dog."</p>

<p>"I know it, sir. I'm sorry if I offended you."</p>

<p>"Promise me to act more civilly in future."</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes. Certainly I shall."</p>

<p>"Then I'll let you go. Let this be a lesson to you. Now,
where did he go?"</p>

<p>"He bought a ticket to New York."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you save all this bother by saying so
in the first place?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I don't know," stammered the fellow in subdued
tones.</p>

<p>Giving him a look of contempt, Old King Brady purchased
a ticket for New York, and said in angry tones:</p>

<p>"For two pins I'd notify the company what a brute you
are, and have a gentleman put here in your place."</p>

<p>And with this rebuke he departed.</p>

<p>He went to a telegraph office and flashed a message to the
authorities of various stations along the line to New York,
asking them to hold La Croix if they caught him on the
cars.</p>

<p>He had to wait an hour for a train to Buffalo, and sent
Harry a message telling where he was going.</p>

<p>Finally he was carried away in his train.</p>

<p>The old detective stopped off at every station to which
he telegraphed, but in every instance he received the same
answer, that nothing was seen of a man answering La
Croix's description.</p>

<p>That set the detective thinking.</p>

<p>"La Croix was probably keen-witted enough to suspect
that we would find his trail and pursue him. In order to
conceal his identity he has doubtless disguised himself and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>thus passed through unrecognized. He has got to dispose
of that big lot of diamonds yet. Carrying such a huge
amount will of course attract a great deal of attention.
Therefore it should be an easy matter to find out where he
is operating when he reaches New York."</p>

<p>On the following day Old King Brady reached the city.</p>

<p>He instituted inquiries about La Croix at once in the
jewelry district, but no one seemed to have seen him yet.</p>

<p>That did not worry Old King Brady.</p>

<p>He was too astute a man to be discouraged by a trifling
rebuff.</p>

<p>"The villain is keeping shady," was the conclusion he
arrived at. "He is going to let the fuss blow over before
he exposes his stock. Very foxy, no doubt, but I'm bound
to land on him sooner or later."</p>

<p>He did not relax his hunt.</p>

<p>Nor did he let on to the authorities that he was in town
again.</p>

<p>He believed in the golden principle of keeping his business
to himself until it became absolutely necessary to disclose
it.</p>

<p>Two days later Harry joined him at their joint lodgings.</p>

<p>Young King Brady told how he had tracked Mrs. La
Croix and her daughter to swell apartments in the luxurious
Waldorf.</p>

<p>Here the pair had taken up their abode under the fictitious
name of Mrs. Marie P. Savoy and daughter.</p>

<p>The Bradys conjectured that it would not take them
long to let La Croix know of their whereabouts.</p>

<p>They therefore carefully shadowed the big hotel.</p>

<p>Nearly a week passed by and one rainy night while
Harry was on watch, under an umbrella, across the street
from the hotel, he saw a hansom cab dash up to the door,
and a man looking like La Croix alighted and hastily made
his way into the building on the Thirty-fourth street side.</p>

<p>"La Croix, as sure as fate!" the boy muttered, hastily
crossing the street.</p>

<p>He was heading for the glass portico, when he happened
to glance into the spacious dining-room and saw the girl
smuggler at supper.</p>

<p>Young King Brady paused and watched her.</p>

<p>Presently a waiter approached her with a card on a salver.</p>

<p>She glanced at it, said something to the man, and while
he hastened away, she resumed her supper in a leisurely
manner.</p>

<p>There were many fashionable guests in the room.</p>

<p>In a few moments Harry saw her father approach her
smilingly, and sit down at the same table with her.</p>

<p>"Now is my time to nab him!" muttered Harry.</p>

<p>He ran into the hotel without ceremony, and making his
way to the door of the dining-room, he paid no heed to the
servants who offered to take his hat, mackintosh and umbrella.</p>

<p>In he dashed, his queer actions causing the guests to
look up at him in astonishment, and he headed for La
Croix.</p>

<p>The Frenchman had a big carving knife in his hand
with which he was going to cut a steak instead of allowing
the waiter to do it.</p>

<p>Harry's hand fell upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"La Croix, you are my prisoner!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>A hoarse cry escaped the smuggler and he became excited
as he noticed that most every one in the room overheard
the remark.</p>

<p>Clara gave a suppressed shriek and sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>Quick to recover his composure the Frenchman put on
his eyeglasses, stared at Harry coolly from head to foot, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Young man, haf you not mek a meestake?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" replied the boy, resolutely. "You are my
man all right."</p>

<p>"Why, sair, I don't know you. I nevair saw you before
een my life."</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;come. You can't cheek it out that way, La
Croix."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, please let go my arm or I have ze vatairs
throw you out of here!"</p>

<p>Harry's patience became exhausted.</p>

<p>He did not intend to mince matters, so he said:</p>

<p>"You stop your humbug and come with me, or I'll
pull you out of here by the neck, do you understand me?"</p>

<p>He took a firm grip on his man with one hand and drew
a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket with the other.</p>

<p>Seeing he could not brave the matter out, and fearing
lest the boy would attempt to handcuff him, the Frenchman
wrenched himself free.</p>

<p>"You geet avay!" he hissed.</p>

<p>"Not without you!" retorted Harry, pluckily.</p>

<p>And he rushed forward to grasp the villain again.</p>

<p>By this time La Croix had become frantic with desperation.</p>

<p>Seeing the boy coming, he drew back the big carving
knife with a quick motion and aimed a blow at the boy,
shouting in the meantime:</p>

<p>"Zen take zat!"</p>

<p>The deadly blade leaped toward Harry's breast.</p>

<p>He tried to avoid it by leaping back, but was too late.</p>

<p>The knife struck him and the point pierced his side.</p>

<p>A sudden cry of agony escaped Young King Brady, and
he flung up his hands and pitched over upon the floor.</p>

<p>Nearly every one in the room having had their attention
attracted toward the pair had witnessed the tragedy.</p>

<p>Men turned pale and leaped to their feet, women shrieked
and fainted, and some of the bolder waiters rushed at the
Frenchman to disarm and capture him.</p>

<p>La Croix brandished the knife.</p>

<p>"I keel ze fairst man who touch me!" he yelled.</p>

<p>Dashing out of the room, he rushed upstairs and flourished
the knife at his pursuers. He swore at every step and
threatened to run the blade into the first man who got
within his reach.</p>

<p>That cowed the crowd and he disappeared on the floor
above.</p>

<h3>RUN TO COVER.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>There was a scene of furious excitement in the hotel
dining-room, and during the confusion, Clara La Croix
made her escape.</p>

<p>Among the guests who had been dining was a physician
who ran to Harry's aid and made a rapid examination of
his wound.</p>

<p>To the many anxious, pale-faced spectators who gathered
round, he said:</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed. It's a mere flesh wound and will
soon heal up."</p>

<p>"Isn't he dead?" demanded a gentleman in a dress-suit,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No. Simply fainted from the shock on his system."</p>

<p>"He's evidently a detective."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and his assailant is a criminal. Waiter, get
me some water&mdash;a sponge&mdash;bandages, and some linament.
I'll bandage this wound and stop the bleeding."</p>

<p>While the doctor was busy working over the unconscious
boy, the hotel detective and a policeman came running in
and got the details.</p>

<p>They hastened away and scoured the hotel in quest of
La Croix.</p>

<p>That worthy had gone to his wife's room.</p>

<p>Garbed in one of her bonnets, veils and dresses, he descended
in the elevator and swiftly got away from the
Waldorf, undetected.</p>

<p>His wife and daughter followed as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>Meantime Harry recovered.</p>

<p>The doctor brought him home in a carriage.</p>

<p>Old King Brady was at home and got the particulars.</p>

<p>His rage knew no bounds when Harry explained all,
after the doctor's departure, and he cried bitterly:</p>

<p>"That villain has caused us more trouble than any
other criminal we ever attempted to run down. I'll even
matters up with him. Had you not retreated just when you
did, that knife would surely have killed you."</p>

<p>"I'll be laid up a few days, the doctor said," replied
Harry, "but I'll soon get over it. If I ever meet La
Croix again, I won't have any mercy on him. He's a bad
man."</p>

<p>The boy then went to bed.</p>

<p>A week afterward, Old King Brady met Harry at police
headquarters, and the boy saw by the look of triumph on
his face that he had good news.</p>

<p>"How are you feeling to-day?" he asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Fine. My wound don't bother me at all."</p>

<p>"I've been working hard, Harry."</p>

<p>"So I imagine, as I haven't seen anything of you since
yesterday."</p>

<p>"La Croix's four spies have arrived in town."</p>

<p>"What! Come from Canada?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I saw them going up Broadway in a bunch,
to-day."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you arrest them?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't. Had my hands full at the time."</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. La Croix."</p>

<p>"Did you catch her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Shopping in Twenty-third street."</p>

<p>"Good enough."</p>

<p>"She's locked up now. I've changed my plans."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think we've made a great mistake in allowing
those women their liberty, hoping they would lead us to
Paul La Croix's hiding place. My new plan is this: To
yank every one of them in, the moment we catch them."</p>

<p>Harry pondered over the proposition a few moments.</p>

<p>As a fact, he did not fancy such a summary proceeding.
He firmly believed that using the different members of the
gang as a bait to trap the others was the most efficient
method of acting.</p>

<p>However, Old King Brady was getting impatient over the
slow progress they were making to arrest the smugglers.
His plan would show a quick result. That's what he
wanted.</p>

<p>The boy, therefore, did not contradict him.</p>

<p>"Any way you say," he replied, presently.</p>

<p>"I'm following out my idea now," said the old detective,
as he took a chew of tobacco. "The moment I saw Mrs.
La Croix, I grabbed her."</p>

<p>"She protested, of course?"</p>

<p>"Vigorously. But I locked her up just the same."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you get any information out of her about the
rest?"</p>

<p>"No. She wouldn't say a word."</p>

<p>"Acts like an old offender."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Her husband and daughter must be somewhere
about the city. I suppose La Croix sent for the
spies. He may have use for them, else they wouldn't be
here. I only hope he hasn't disposed of any of those
stones yet."</p>

<p>"And I've sent a warning to all jewelers, pawnbrokers
and dealers in gems, not to handle La Croix's gems under
penalty of the law. I've offered them a reward for the
smuggler's arrest. The villain is bound to keep shady
now. He must know the danger he is in. He's a very
foxy Frenchman," said Harry.</p>

<p>"I wish I could find out where the woman lives."</p>

<p>"Nothing easier," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Don't you fool yourself. She won't confess."</p>

<p>"I don't expect she will."</p>

<p>"Then how am I to find out?"</p>

<p>"You said she was shopping in Twenty-third street?"</p>

<p>"I caught her coming out of Sterns' store."</p>

<p>"What's more likely than that she made some purchases
and ordered the things sent home?"</p>

<p>Old King Brady's face brightened.</p>

<p>He had not thought of her leaving her address.</p>

<p>"Your idea is all right!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of course it is. It only has one drawback."</p>

<p>"And what's that?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>"She may have given a fictitious name."</p>

<p>"True. But she favors the name of Marie Savoy."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do any harm to try asking for it."</p>

<p>"Come with me and see what we can do."</p>

<p>They left headquarters and hastened to the big dry goods
store.</p>

<p>Going to the delivery department they asked the head
clerk if he had anything on his books to be delivered to
either Mrs. La Croix or Savoy.</p>

<p>A short search of the record elicited this response:</p>

<p>"I've got twenty yards of dress goods to be delivered to
Mrs. M.P. Savoy."</p>

<p>"Bought a couple of hours ago?" asked Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"About that."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to deliver it?"</p>

<p>"At No. 160 Bleecker street."</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"Anything wrong about it?"</p>

<p>"No. It's paid for, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What time are you going to deliver the parcel?"</p>

<p>"Our wagon ought to reach there about five o'clock."</p>

<p>Old King Brady thanked him and they departed, leaving
the clerk looking very much mystified over their peculiar
actions.</p>

<p>The Bradys went to the Bleecker street address and saw
that it was one of a row of old-fashioned brick houses
with green blinds.</p>

<p>There was an ornamental iron stoop in front, and a
furnished room sign hanging in one of the windows.</p>

<p>"Shall we go in?" asked Harry, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"No. Wait for the wagon. We can then see who comes
to the door. I presume they only have furnished rooms
here."</p>

<p>"It's a poor neighborhood."</p>

<p>"So much the better for their purpose, perhaps."</p>

<p>They entered a saloon on the corner and took up a position
where they could watch the house over the window
screen.</p>

<p>They had not been there long before Harry caught view of
two familiar figures coming down the street and called
his partner's attention to them.</p>

<p>"Here comes two of La Croix's spies!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they are going into the house," muttered Old
King Brady.</p>

<p>"That clinches our doubts. He surely must live there."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it. It's a strange servant admitting them.
She's a mulatto."</p>

<p>The men disappeared in the house.</p>

<p>An hour passed by uneventfully.</p>

<p>Then Sterns' wagon came along and Old King Brady
said hastily:</p>

<p>"When that driver rings, we must force our way in."</p>

<p>"Hurry up, then!"</p>

<p>Running across the street they arrived just in time to
go up the stoop with the driver, and when he rang, the
colored girl answered the bell.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Savoy live here?" demanded the driver, who had
a bundle.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl. "Parcel for her?"</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>He handed it over and went away.</p>

<p>"Is the lady in?" Old King Brady asked the girl.</p>

<p>"No, sir. But her daughter is."</p>

<p>"We'd like to see her on important business."</p>

<p>"Come inside, if you please."</p>

<p>She ushered them into the parlor and asked:</p>

<p>"What name?"</p>

<p>"The Bradys."</p>

<p>"Wait here, sir."</p>

<p>She left the room and they silently followed her.</p>

<p>Pushing open the door of the back parlor the girl said:</p>

<p>"Miss Savoy&mdash;the Bradys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At your service!" added Harry.</p>

<p>And they strode into the room where Clara La Croix
sat.</p>

<h3>A HUMAN SHIELD.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>It was a beautifully furnished bedroom and the girl
smuggler sat by the window reading a novel when the
detectives rushed in at her.</p>

<p>She was a cool, level-headed girl, and seemed to possess
a remarkable set of nerves for she did not look at all
startled by their entrance.</p>

<p>Meeting the detectives' look with a cool stare, she asked,
quietly:</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Then seeing the astonished servant lingering at the door,
she added:</p>

<p>"You may go, Hattie."</p>

<p>The servant closed the door and vanished.</p>

<p>Old King Brady strode over to her and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"We want those smuggled diamonds."</p>

<p>"Really, you are provoking. I have no smuggled diamonds."</p>

<p>"But you know where they are!"</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You fooled us once, very cleverly, by passing
them to the hotel hall-boy, but you shan't do so again, I can
tell you."</p>

<p>She laughed as if enjoying a good joke.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, finally, "evasions are useless I see."</p>

<p>"Perfectly!"</p>

<p>"Do you want me to be frank with you?"</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, lies ain't going to do you any
earthly good."</p>

<p>"The gems you are after are in my father's possession."</p>

<p>"We know that much already."</p>

<p>"To get them you must first get him."</p>

<p>"That's manifest."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>"As for smuggling them onto American soil, none of us
did that."</p>

<p>"But you caused one of your spies to do so for you."</p>

<p>"Admitted."</p>

<p>"And you have them now."</p>

<p>"So we have."</p>

<p>"That makes you as guilty as if you did the work of
smuggling yourself."</p>

<p>"So I presume. We connived the trick, for our own
benefit, to cheat the Custom House. We ain't denying that.
In fact, it's going to be a big thing for us. Now, we don't
wish to be pestered with your persecutions any longer."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can help yourself."</p>

<p>"We do."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Name your price to quit."</p>

<p>"You mean to bribe us off, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's about the size of it."</p>

<p>"We are not to be bought."</p>

<p>"Humbug! I never knew a Custom House officer to
refuse."</p>

<p>"We ain't of that stamp, young lady."</p>

<p>She looked at him incredulously a moment, and saw by
the stern look in his deep gray eyes that he meant what he
said.</p>

<p>It seemed to unnerve her for a moment.</p>

<p>She reflected and finally asked:</p>

<p>"Are you determined?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely!"</p>

<p>"You are bound to hound us?"</p>

<p>"We are, until we gain our point."</p>

<p>"This is astonishing."</p>

<p>"Are you aware that we have your mother in jail?"</p>

<p>A look of alarm swept over her face, the color fled from
her cheeks and she slowly rose to her feet and asked in
strained tones:</p>

<p>"What! My mother in prison?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and you are going to join her in a few moments."</p>

<p>"Mr. Brady, you are very much mistaken."</p>

<p>"Why am I?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you, sir."</p>

<p>She gave utterance to a cough. It was a signal. Instantly
the door of an ante-room flew open. In the opening
stood four men. They were the spies.</p>

<p>Each one was armed with a revolver.</p>

<p>These weapons were aimed at the Bradys and the girl
laughed outright when she saw the involuntary expressions
of astonishment that swept over their features.</p>

<p>"Quite a surprise, isn't it?" she asked in grim tones.</p>

<p>"We are in a trap!" Harry muttered.</p>

<p>"That's the situation!" said the girl, quietly. "If you
move hand or foot, you'll get shot. Those men never miss
their mark. At such short range they could kill you even
if they were not expert shots."</p>

<p>The Bradys saw the force of her reasoning.</p>

<p>In a word, they were helpless.</p>

<p>Neither attempted to draw a weapon in self-defense.</p>

<p>To do so would be to seal their doom.</p>

<p>An awkward silence ensued.</p>

<p>Old King Brady finally asked in gruff tones:</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Make prisoners of you and hold you until we have
disposed of the diamonds," quickly replied Clara.</p>

<p>The detectives looked disgusted.</p>

<p>"Shall we resist?" muttered Harry, desperately.</p>

<p>"No. It would be folly to attempt it," his partner replied.</p>

<p>Old King Brady was not so fiery and impetuous as the
boy; he was more slow, deliberate and cool in the face of
danger.</p>

<p>He saw that the smugglers had concluded to throw off
the mask and make no further pretenses.</p>

<p>That meant bitter warfare.</p>

<p>He had no plan to suggest, and the girl exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come in and bind them, Jean."</p>

<p>One of the men entered.</p>

<p>He was the man who had done the smuggling.</p>

<p>Walking over to the detectives, he said to them in low
tones:</p>

<p>"If you resist, my friends will fire."</p>

<p>"We don't intend to," replied Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"Then I'll relieve you of your own handcuffs to secure
you."</p>

<p>He felt in the old detective's pocket, brought out the
steel bracelets and snapped them on the detective.</p>

<p>Young King Brady was very restless.</p>

<p>To submit without a fight was more than he could bear.</p>

<p>His obstinacy suddenly got the best of his good judgment,
and he made up his mind to give them a tussle.</p>

<p>Leaping beside the girl he seized her, swung her around
between himself and the other men and cried:</p>

<p>"If you fire, you'll hit this girl!"</p>

<p>Clara gave a shriek.</p>

<p>"Harry!" roared Old King Brady in some dismay.</p>

<p>The men in the doorway dared not fire.</p>

<p>Jean, fearing an attack, plunged across the room in
tending to get out of danger in the hall.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" gasped the girl.</p>

<p>"Give up my advantage? Never!" panted the boy, a
reckless, daring light gleaming in his eyes.</p>

<p>He was close to the open window.</p>

<p>At a glance he saw a way to escape.</p>

<p>Unaided, he could not expect to arrest these men and
the girl, for Old King Brady was rendered powerless.</p>

<p>The yard was only eight feet below.</p>

<p>"Can you jump out the window?" he asked his partner.</p>

<p>"They'll fire if I budge."</p>

<p>This remark was certainly true.</p>

<p>While Harry had the advantage of using the girl as a
shield, the four Canadians held the old detective at their
mercy.</p>

<p>Harry drew his pistol.</p>

<p>The girl began to struggle to get free.</p>

<p>"Keep still!" said the boy in threatening tones. "If
any harm befalls my partner, I'll put a bullet in you, young
woman!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>The terrible earnestness of his voice alarmed her.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't injure a lady, would you?" she asked,
appealing to his manhood. "No gentleman would do that."</p>

<p>"You are only a criminal," he replied coldly, "and as it's
a case of our lives or yours, I wouldn't hesitate to shoot
you to save ourselves."</p>

<p>Detectives are not sentimental.</p>

<p>On the contrary, their work makes them harsh.</p>

<p>Harry wanted to scare the girl and he succeeded well, for
she remained passive, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>The boy quickly saw his advantage and cried:</p>

<p>"Now, if any of your gang attempts to injure us, I'll
kill you!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he placed the muzzle of his pistol against
her head, turned her around and backed over to Old King
Brady.</p>

<p>"Come!" he whispered. "We'll use her as a shield and
back over to the door. They'll bitterly rue it if they fire!"</p>

<p>The four spies looked desperate and one of them spoke
to the girl in French as the detectives retreated, holding
her between them and their enemies. The girl replied in
English, saying:</p>

<p>"Never mind me. We must not let them escape. Tackle
them."</p>

<p>Obeying her, they rushed toward the officers.</p>

<p>Harry aimed his pistol at them and fired twice.</p>

<p>"Go for the door!" he yelled.</p>

<p>And hurling the girl against the four Canadians, he and
his partner rushed out into the hall. The door was locked.</p>

<h3>ON HARLEM BRIDGE.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Upstairs with you!" gasped Harry. "We can't get out
the front door."</p>

<p>Old King Brady saw that the girl had collided with the
four smugglers and they all fell in a heap upon the parlor
floor.</p>

<p>The detective rushed up the stairs.</p>

<p>On the top landing Old King Brady panted:</p>

<p>"Unlock these handcuffs!"</p>

<p>Harry obeyed in an instant.</p>

<p>Just then the gang came rushing from the parlor, and
were about to ascend the stairs when Harry opened fire
on them.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! went three shots.</p>

<p>He was a dead shot and could have killed those desperadoes
had he been inclined to. But he merely shot to wound
them.</p>

<p>The yells of pain that followed showed how true his
aim was.</p>

<p>Two of the Canadians were hit.</p>

<p>A stampede among them ensued.</p>

<p>Back to the parlor they rushed, swearing and groaning,
and the detectives laughed at them, for the tables were
now turned.</p>

<p>The Bradys had the advantage.</p>

<p>At the head of those stairs they could have held an army
at bay.</p>

<p>Old King Brady got his handcuffs from his wrists, put
them in his pocket and withdrew his own revolver.</p>

<p>"By thunder!" he muttered. "I'm glad you made that
dash, Harry."</p>

<p>"We would now be helpless prisoners if I hadn't."</p>

<p>Just then several lodgers stuck their heads out of the
doors of their rooms, alarmed at the shots and yells.</p>

<p>Seeing the two armed detectives, they shouted with alarm,
withdrew into the rooms, banged their doors shut and
some rushed to the windows, flung them open and screamed:</p>

<p>"Murder! Murder! Help! Police!"</p>

<p>The cries startled the neighborhood.</p>

<p>For a moment everyone was in an uproar. A big crowd
gathered before the house and several policemen came running
to the scene from different directions, looking for
trouble.</p>

<p>A suspicious silence ensued down on the parlor floor.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they've skipped?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"I'm going to venture down and see," replied his partner.</p>

<p>They dashed down the stairs, holding their pistols in
readiness for use, and ran into the parlor.</p>

<p>It was empty.</p>

<p>Passing back into Clara's room, they found it vacant.</p>

<p>"Gone!" exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>"Not by the front," replied his partner. "The door and
windows are locked."</p>

<p>"Let's try the basement."</p>

<p>Down they ran, nervous over the disappearance of the
smugglers and in the dining-room found the mulatto girl
Hattie.</p>

<p>She sat in terror, with her face buried in her hands, and
when she saw them rush in with drawn pistols, she
shrieked:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't kill me! Don't kill me!"</p>

<p>"Where did that Savoy girl and the four men go?"
sternly asked Old King Brady, glancing around the room.</p>

<p>"Out the back door."</p>

<p>"Into the yard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The police began pounding on the front doors just as the
Bradys rushed out into the rear yard.</p>

<p>Just as they emerged. Harry saw the figure of Jean disappearing
over the back fence and pointing at it, he cried
excitedly:</p>

<p>"There they go!"</p>

<p>"After them!" roared Old King Brady.</p>

<p>They rushed across the yard.</p>

<p>Over the fence they climbed like a couple of cats, and
leaping into the yard of an adjoining tenement, they ran
for the hall.</p>

<p>Blood spots on the flags left a plain trail.</p>

<p>The wounded men had dropped it in their flight, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>the detectives easily traced the stains through the hall into
the street.</p>

<p>Hearing wild yells, they saw a baker's wagon dashing
along at a furious gallop, and saw Clara and her friends
in it.</p>

<p>The owner of the wagon was racing out of his store.</p>

<p>A small boy had told him that a gang had stolen his
horse and wagon and it was his yells the detectives heard.</p>

<p>He was a fat German and he paused in the middle of
the street, wildly waving his arms and crying in despairing
tones:</p>

<p>"<i>Ach Gott!</i> I vos robbed! Dey shtole mein horse und
vagon!"</p>

<p>The Bradys started off on a run after the vehicle.</p>

<p>Block after block was covered until the wagon, far in
advance of the detectives, swung around the corner into
West Broadway.</p>

<p>Here, panting and foam-covered, the horse was reined in.</p>

<p>The fugitives alighted.</p>

<p>"We are going to lose them now," groaned Old King
Brady.</p>

<p>"I don't see why," returned Harry, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Don't you see they're going for the elevated?"</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, so they are!"</p>

<p>The five rushed up the stairs on the downtown side, just
as a train pulled into the station.</p>

<p>After them ran the Bradys, hoping fervently that they
would miss the train. But they were doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>When the detectives reached the platform, the train was
steaming away and they saw their enemies in the last car.</p>

<p>"That's the end of them!" said Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"Can't we have them headed off by telephoning down
to the Battery station?" eagerly asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Might try."</p>

<p>Down the street they went and as there was a public
telephone near by, they sent the message down.</p>

<p>Then they took the next train down.</p>

<p>The train on which the fugitives stopped was yet at the
Battery station and they found the gateman of the last car
and Harry asked him:</p>

<p>"Did you notice where the four men in black, and a hatless
girl of sixteen who got on at the Bleecker street station
alighted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I remember them. They only rode one station
and got off at Grand street."</p>

<p>This reply gave the Bradys a shock.</p>

<p>"We are baffled!" exclaimed Old King Brady in disgust.</p>

<p>"They're a shrewd set," Harry added.</p>

<p>They spoke to the stationmaster too, but he said they
had not come down to the Battery and repeated what the
gateman said.</p>

<p>The Bradys rode back to Grand street.</p>

<p>Here they made careful and endless inquiries.</p>

<p>All the information they could get came from the boy
who had the news-stand on the corner.</p>

<p>He had seen the fugitives.</p>

<p>They had boarded a Grand street car going eastward.</p>

<p>He did not notice the number of the car, but thought the
officers would find it down at the ferry.</p>

<p>Hiring a cab they were driven fast.</p>

<p>Reaching the ferry, several blue cars were found.</p>

<p>Inquiry among the conductors followed, and they presently
discovered the one on whose car Clara and the spies
had ridden.</p>

<p>He informed them that the fugitives alighted at the
Bowery with transfer tickets on the uptown side.</p>

<p>Back went the Bradys to the Bowery.</p>

<p>"If we stick to their trail long enough," commented
Harry, "we may finally locate them. But it's going to be a
hard job."</p>

<p>"We'll beat the car they're in by taking the elevated,"
said the old detective as he dismissed the cab. "Up at the
stables we may learn which car passed Grand street quarter
of an hour ago."</p>

<p>"It's worth while trying."</p>

<p>So up they went.</p>

<p>When they reached the stable, they were disgusted to
find that the cars which passed the corner of Grand and
the Bowery about the time the smugglers boarded one,
were all gone ten minutes before.</p>

<p>But one more course was open to the detectives.</p>

<p>That was to proceed to Harlem bridge on the elevated and
make another effort to head off the fugitives at the terminal
of the road.</p>

<p>Once more they started.</p>

<p>Each defeat whetted their appetite more to capture the
fugitives.</p>

<p>The elevated cars passed many of the surface cars, and
when the 129th street station was reached, they went down
to the street.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to start for the surface cars, to
begin making inquiries, Harry glanced over at the Harlem
bridge.</p>

<p>To his surprise and joy he saw Clara and the four spies
hurrying over the structure on foot.</p>

<p>"There they are at last!" he cried, pointing at the party.</p>

<p>Old King Brady was startled.</p>

<p>He saw them the next moment.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he cried.</p>

<p>Off on a run they went, and passed out on the bridge.</p>

<p>The fugitives were half way over the structure and two
of the men who were wounded in the legs were limping
painfully.</p>

<p>Rushing up behind them noiselessly, Harry and his
partner each grasped a man by the neck.</p>

<h3>PUMPING A PRISONER.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Gentlemen, you are our prisoners!" cried Harry.</p>

<p>The bursting of a bomb could not have startled the
smugglers more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>With cries of affright, they glanced around and seeing
who was attacking them, they were more startled than ever.</p>

<p>The detectives had grasped the wounded men.</p>

<p>Seeing their peril, the two uninjured Canadians rushed
to the rescue.</p>

<p>With one accord, the detectives hurled their prisoners to
the planks of the bridge and sprang forward eagerly to
meet their foes.</p>

<p>The next moment the smugglers drew their pistols.</p>

<p>Before they could fire a shot, the detectives let their
fists fly, and in a moment more a terrific fight was going on.</p>

<p>During the fracas Clara escaped.</p>

<p>Bang! went Old King Brady's powerful fist against the
jaw of one of the villains, and it knocked the man flat on
his back.</p>

<p>He was stunned.</p>

<p>As he fell close to the wounded man whom Harry had
flung down, the old officer whipped out his handcuffs and
linked the pair together.</p>

<p>Harry had kicked the pistol out of his opponent's hand.</p>

<p>The man now had to depend upon his fists.</p>

<p>Both he and Young King Brady met with a crash and
were punching each other furiously when the old detective
arose.</p>

<p>It was Jean, the one who had smuggled the diamonds
over the border, and Harry was delighted over the discovery.</p>

<p>The young detective was a scientific boxer.</p>

<p>He warded off several heavy swings and gave Jean an
upper cut on the mouth that split his lips open.</p>

<p>The man recoiled, but Harry followed him up like a bull
dog.</p>

<p>He received a painful blow in the stomach, and caught
Jean's foot as he aimed a swinging kick at the boy.</p>

<p>Harry clung to the man's ankle.</p>

<p>Giving it a jerk, he upset the Canadian's balance and
Jean fell with a crash, and rolled over.</p>

<p>He was just going to rise when the boy pounced on him,
and a fierce struggle began for the mastery.</p>

<p>Old King Brady would have gone to his pupil's aid had
not the other wounded man drawn a pistol and opened
fire on him.</p>

<p>A bullet whistled past the old detective's head.</p>

<p>He sprang at the man just as he was about to fire a
second shot and grasping him by the wrist, turned the pistol
aside.</p>

<p>The ball was spent harmlessly in the air.</p>

<p>Jabbering in French, the man made an effort to wrench
the weapon free, but Old King Brady was too quick for
him.</p>

<p>He brought down his fist on the rascal's arm.</p>

<p>The force of that blow was awful.</p>

<p>It numbed the arm and the pistol fell from his nerveless
fingers.</p>

<p>The next moment Old King Brady's fist caught him on
the nose, almost smashing that organ flat, and as the
Canadian bit the dust, the detective landed on top of him
like a tiger seizing its prey.</p>

<p>"I've got you now!" exclaimed the old detective, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" groaned the man.</p>

<p>"Roll over."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Place your hands behind your back."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now keep still, or I'll strangle you."</p>

<p>Old King Brady tied the man with his handkerchief and
rose.</p>

<p>By the time he got upon his feet, Harry had overpowered
Jean and had the bracelets on his wrists.</p>

<p>"Victory!" chuckled the boy.</p>

<p>"Four," said the old detective. "That ain't a bad haul!"</p>

<p>"But the girl has escaped."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Harry. We are well paid for our work."</p>

<p>The shots, noise, fight and general excitement, had
brought a crowd rushing to the spot. There was a policeman
among them.</p>

<p>But they arrived too late to be of any assistance.</p>

<p>Rushing up to the Bradys officiously, the panting policeman
asked:</p>

<p>"What's the matter here?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Harry.</p>

<p>"Do you call that nothing?" asked the policeman, grabbing
the boy.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;you!" exclaimed Old King Brady, showing his
badge. "Let go that detective and ring up the wagon so we
can run in these prisoners. Step lively now, and don't
try to be too smart."</p>

<p>"Detective?" asked the policeman.</p>

<p>Harry showed his badge.</p>

<p>The policeman wilted, and the crowd laughed at him.</p>

<p>Without a word he hurried away to order the patrol
wagon.</p>

<p>It soon arrived.</p>

<p>The prisoners were lifted aboard and accompanied by
the Bradys, were driven to the nearest police station.</p>

<p>Formal complaints were entered against the four Canadians
and when they were locked up, the detectives departed.</p>

<p>In the street Harry said to his partner:</p>

<p>"After all, we haven't accomplished such a lot."</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Old King Brady, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because we've only got Mrs. La Croix and the four
spies."</p>

<p>"Well, ain't they valuable?"</p>

<p>"Of course. But they are of the least consequence in this
case. We don't know where the diamonds are, and both
La Croix and his daughter are yet at large."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll find them before long. As for the diamonds,
why, La Croix can't offer them to any big dealer in this
city, Boston, Philadelphia, or Chicago, but what we will
be informed of the fact."</p>

<p>"He hasn't made any effort to dispose of them yet, then."</p>

<p>"No. We would have heard of it, if he had."</p>

<p>"There are plenty of unscrupulous people who would
buy them in small lots, and thus he'd gradually get rid of
the whole lot."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"That ain't La Croix's game. He expects to save
$35,000 duty on those gems, besides about $15,000 profit
which he expects to make. He's got to do his work quick
to gain his money. With a stake of $50,000 to work for,
he's going to give us a hard fight."</p>

<p>"Of course. Can't you put the screws on the prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Make them confess?"</p>

<p>"One of the bunch might squeal."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if we give them the Third Degree."</p>

<p>"Try it. They must know where the Frenchman and
his daughter are."</p>

<p>"I shall. It's our only chance to locate the diamonds."</p>

<p>They went home and laid out a plan.</p>

<p>Before the prisoners were brought to court next morning,
the Bradys appeared at the police station and had a talk
with the captain.</p>

<p>He fell in with their views and said:</p>

<p>"You are at liberty to pump the prisoners here, if you
can."</p>

<p>Accompanied by the doorkeeper, the detectives went back
to the cell occupied by Jean.</p>

<p>The man was nervously pacing to and fro and glanced at
the detectives with an ugly scowl, when they entered.</p>

<p>Pausing before them he demanded:</p>

<p>"Have you come to gloat over my misery?"</p>

<p>"No. We are not so cruel. All we want is some information."</p>

<p>"What about, Old King Brady?"</p>

<p>"The smuggled diamonds."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?"</p>

<p>"We'll arrest your bride!"</p>

<p>The man turned pale, for the detective had touched his
weakest point.</p>

<p>Grasping Old King Brady's arm, he said in appealing
tones:</p>

<p>"Don't do that. She is innocent. Why drag her into
my trouble?"</p>

<p>"She was with you when the diamonds were smuggled."</p>

<p>"True. But she didn't know anything about it. She
didn't have anything to do with the work. I alone am the
guilty party."</p>

<p>"That don't make any difference to us. If you don't
make a clean breast of the matter, I'll pull her in. That
settles it!"</p>

<p>The Canadian pondered a few moments.</p>

<p>Then he said with a sigh:</p>

<p>"Well, I may as well tell you La Croix has got them.
You'd find it out anyway, the way you are following up
this case."</p>

<p>"Of course I will. And what's more, we know he's got
them. But what I want to know most of all, is, where is
La Croix?"</p>

<p>"At the Astor House."</p>

<p>"Under what name?"</p>

<p>"His wife's maiden name: Savoy."</p>

<p>"Does Clara know it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Are any of the diamonds sold yet?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know. But they will be."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-day."</p>

<p>"He has found a purchaser for the lot?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. They are to meet in the Astor House to-day
at twelve and end the sale."</p>

<p>Old King Brady glanced hastily at his watch.</p>

<p>It was then half-past eleven and to reach the Astor
House would take three-quarters of an hour!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE CAPTURE OF LA CROIX.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Leaving the prisoner's cell, the Bradys hastened from the
police station and hastily getting aboard a City Hall train
on the elevated road, they went downtown.</p>

<p>"As it takes about three-quarters of an hour to get down
to the bridge," said Harry, in anxious tones, "I'm afraid we
will reach the Astor House too late to prevent the consummation
of that diamond sale."</p>

<p>"Well, that depends upon how long it is going to take
La Croix and his customer to arrive at a bargain," said
Old King Brady, quietly.</p>

<p>He was not very nervous over the matter.</p>

<p>Taking a chew of plug tobacco, he settled back comfortably
in his seat, drew a newspaper from his pocket and
began to read the news.</p>

<p>Harry watched him restlessly.</p>

<p>The boy was very impatient.</p>

<p>"I can't understand how you can take it so cool," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"What's the good of fuming and fretting? It isn't going
to hurry us, is it?"</p>

<p>"No. But La Croix may beat us."</p>

<p>"Keep cool. The more you worry, the warmer you'll
get."</p>

<p>That ride downtown was torture to Young King Brady,
and there wasn't a minute he did not have his watch in his
hand and kept counting the minutes as they slipped by.</p>

<p>It was with a deep sense of relief that he saw the train
stop at the bridge and he was the first one off the cars.</p>

<p>"Quarter past twelve," he growled, feverishly, "and it
will take us five or ten minutes longer to reach the hotel."</p>

<p>"Have patience&mdash;" began Old King Brady.</p>

<p>"Can't do it. Let's run, or I'll get wild!"</p>

<p>They made rapid time down Park Row and crossing past
the post-office, they hastened into the hotel.</p>

<p>Going to the desk, they asked the clerk:</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Savoy here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Room 76. Name, please."</p>

<p>"He's a friend. We wish to surprise him. Is he in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I'll send a boy up with you."</p>

<p>"Anyone call on him to-day?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul."</p>

<p>"Not a soul?" blankly asked Harry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>"Except yourselves," laughed the clerk.</p>

<p>Old King Brady burst into a hearty peal of laughter,
but not at what the clerk said, for he was laughing at
Harry for being so impatient.</p>

<p>The boy drew a deep breath and wiped the sweat from
his forehead.</p>

<p>"Thank fortune, we're in time!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"You've had all your stewing for nothing."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad of it. His customer must be late."</p>

<p>"All the better for us. This experience will teach you a
good lesson in our profession&mdash;namely, never to get excited."</p>

<p>"I'll try to profit by it," said Harry, quietly.</p>

<p>Just then a boy came running up and the clerk said:</p>

<p>"Show these gentlemen up to 76&mdash;Mr. Savoy's room."</p>

<p>Just as they were about to follow the boy, a tall, thin
man, without whiskers, came along and seeing the Bradys,
gave a slight start.</p>

<p>The Bradys got a good look at him before he turned
his back to them and Harry clutched his companion's arm
and whispered:</p>

<p>"By jove, that's Andrew Gibson, the Custom House inspector,
in disguise."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Old King Brady, nodding, "I recognized
him. He knew us, too, I could tell at a glance. That man
hates us. I wonder what he is doing here. Can he be after
La Croix, too?"</p>

<p>Harry was startled at the very suggestion.</p>

<p>"He knows La Croix is a professional smuggler," he
remarked, "and I wouldn't be surprised if he got on to the
man living here. He may be trying to nab him as we are
doing."</p>

<p>"He won't cheat us out of our prey this way, Harry."</p>

<p>Just then they heard the inspector say to the clerk:</p>

<p>"Send up my card to Mr. Savoy. He expects me. I was
to meet him at twelve o'clock on some business, but was
detained."</p>

<p>The Bradys darted startled glances at each other.</p>

<p>Gibson's remark exposed his hand.</p>

<p>He was the supposed jeweler with whom La Croix had
been negotiating to sell the contraband diamonds.</p>

<p>The Bradys had arrived just in time to prevent this
man from cheating them out of their legitimate prey.</p>

<p>Had they been delayed a few minutes longer Gibson
would have had La Croix under arrest and the smuggled
diamonds in his possession.</p>

<p>After all their arduous work, he would have stepped in
at the last moment and gained the credit for the arrest.</p>

<p>It made the Bradys shiver to think of it.</p>

<p>Harry said to the hall-boy:</p>

<p>"Go ahead, as fast as you can!"</p>

<p>They hastened upstairs while the hotel clerk was writing
Gibson's name on a card, and the boy knocked at the
door of No. 76.</p>

<p>"Who ees zat?" demanded La Croix's voice from within.</p>

<p>"Boy, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! An' vat you vant?"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes. I expect him. Wait, I open ze door."</p>

<p>"Go!" whispered Harry to the boy.</p>

<p>The little fellow ran downstairs.</p>

<p>La Croix unlocked the door and stuck out his head.</p>

<p>"Come in, Meestair Geebson&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>And the Bradys interrupted him by rushing against the
door; it hit La Croix on the shoulder, sending him reeling
back into the room, and he gave a yell as the detectives
dashed in.</p>

<p>"<i>Par Dieu!</i> Ze detectives!" he screamed.</p>

<p>Then he began to yell, swear, and rave in French, as he
scrambled to his feet, and the officers made a rush for him.</p>

<p>"Ze Bradys! Ze Bradys!" he shrieked.</p>

<p>At first they imagined these cries were due to his excitement.
But when he backed up against a door opening
into an adjoining room with his arms stretched out, they
saw through his purpose.</p>

<p>"Harry!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He's warning some one in the next room."</p>

<p>"I'll see!"</p>

<p>The boy dashed out into the hall.</p>

<p>Old King Brady had his pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>Taking aim at the man's head, he roared in stern tones:</p>

<p>"Drop on your knees!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't fiair!" yelled La Croix, obeying.</p>

<p>"Raise your hands!"</p>

<p>"Sairtainly, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Now don't budge, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>He made a threatening gesture with the pistol at the wild-eyed
Frenchman, from whose face all vestige of color had
fled.</p>

<p>"No! No!" gasped La Croix, imploringly.</p>

<p>Reaching his side, the detective handcuffed him.</p>

<p>Just then a boy knocked at the hall door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" cried the old detective.</p>

<p>"Boy, sir."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gibson wants to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Send him up."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Just then the door between the two rooms was flung open
and Harry strode through with a puzzled look upon his face.</p>

<p>"No one in here," he announced.</p>

<p>A pleased smile crossed La Croix's face.</p>

<p>Observing it, Old King Brady exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Your daughter was in that room, wasn't she?"</p>

<p>"She was," admitted La Croix, "but she hear ze attack
and escape."</p>

<p>"You warned her by yelling our names?"</p>

<p>"I deed, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Confound you! Where are those diamonds?"</p>

<p>"Clara has got zem."</p>

<p>"Don't lie."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>"Sairch ze place an' you see."</p>

<p>The Bradys complied, but failed to find the missing
diamonds.</p>

<p>"I'll go after her!" cried Harry, hastily, and he rushed
out.</p>

<p>A few moments after he had gone, Gibson came in, and
a look of mingled surprise, rage and jealousy crossed his
face when he saw the situation of affairs.</p>

<p>"How are you, Gibson?" laughed Old King Brady.
"I've got La Croix!"</p>

<p>"You've cheated me!" snarled the inspector, furiously.</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, you've got the matter twisted. It
was you interfering with our game. We've been after this
man two months. And you ain't going to skim the cream
off our hard work, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"You lie, Brady&mdash;"</p>

<p>An angry light sparkled in the old detective's eyes at
this insult and he doubled up his fist, strode over to the
inspector and struck him in the face.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare insult me, you cur!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Gibson reeled back swearing, and seeing the old detective
coming at him again, he rushed from the room shouting
wildly:</p>

<p>"I'll pay you off for that blow!"</p>

<h3>RECOVERING THE DIAMONDS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>When Harry ran from La Croix's room, he passed Andrew
Gibson in the hall, and smiled when he thought of
the man's coming surprise.</p>

<p>Racing downstairs, the boy made inquiries at the different
entrances to the hotel, for information about the girl
smuggler.</p>

<p>A man had seen her go out the Vesey street door.</p>

<p>As he was interested in her pretty face, he watched her
a few moments and had seen her go hurrying over to
Broadway.</p>

<p>She had kept on the west side of the street and was evidently
going downtown on foot in the dense crowd thronging
the street.</p>

<p>With this meagre clew to follow, Harry hurried away.</p>

<p>"She had the gems," he muttered. "Perhaps she had
an idea of selling them quick to raise money to aid her
parents, both of whom she now knows are in trouble. She's
a wise girl, and must certainly know that she would be
helpless to aid them without money. Money will give
her power. It's possible, therefore, that she's heading for
the jewelry district, which is near by. As the street is
crowded with vehicles and she'd have to cross to reach
Maiden Lane or John street, she must have gone over under
the protection of a policeman. He would remember her
and might post me. I'll try all the big cops from here down
to Wall street, if necessary."</p>

<p>Harry knew that the largest part of the time of these
officers was spent at escorting people across the crowded
street.</p>

<p>He therefore began with the policeman at Fulton street,
giving him an accurate description of Clara, but the officer
had not seen her.</p>

<p>On the corner of Dey street he met with the same result.</p>

<p>At Cortlandt street he gained a clew.</p>

<p>The officer there had piloted a girl over who answered her
description and said she had gone down the Lane on the
north side.</p>

<p>Harry hastened down the great jewelry center.</p>

<p>He scrutinized every one he met.</p>

<p>As a general rule, excepting girls who are employed in
the business houses of the downtown section of the city,
but few females frequent the side streets.</p>

<p>In fact, so few pass through these streets, that when they
do, they are noticed by the numerous boys and business men
thereabouts.</p>

<p>Harry was relying upon this curious, but true fact, to
gain some news of the girl he was pursuing.</p>

<p>He therefore did not hesitate to ask everyone with whom
he came in contact if they had seen such a girl as Clara was.</p>

<p>In some cases he received a negative answer, while in
others, not a few people admitted they had noticed her.</p>

<p>According to the latter information, he traced her to
Nassau street, and an Italian apple vender with a push-cart
near the corner, said he had seen her turn the corner
and proceed toward John street.</p>

<p>Following up this clew, Harry met a man standing near
the window of a haberdasher's store who asserted that he
had seen such a person go through John street toward
Broadway.</p>

<p>He averred that she had gone into a building near the
corner and pointed out the place to the young detective.</p>

<p>When Harry reached the building in question, he paused
and studied the business men's signs in the doorway.</p>

<p>One in particular attracted his attention, worded this
way:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Cliquot &amp; Co., Diamonds, Second Floor Front."</p></div>

<p>A curious smile flitted over the young detective's face
and he passed into the narrow hall and ascended the stairs
muttering:</p>

<p>"I wonder if she's in there?"</p>

<p>In the upper hall he saw the name of the dealer in
precious stones, painted on the ground-glass window.</p>

<p>Harry opened the door and strode in.</p>

<p>He found himself in a small office containing two huge
Herring safes, guarded with burglar alarm cabinets. A
long table covered with blue cloth served as a counter. Near
the front windows was a bookkeeper working at his desk.
At the rear a small compartment was partitioned off
to serve as a private office.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>A fat little Frenchman was behind the counter, but
Harry did not see any signs of Clara La Croix.</p>

<p>A feeling of disappointment overcame him.</p>

<p>The salesman bowed, looked at him inquiringly, and
asked politely:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what can I do for you to-day?"</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Cliquot in?" asked Harry, in low tones.</p>

<p>The salesman smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "He is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead? But the name on your sign&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is only kept as a firm name. His partner is in."</p>

<p>"Are you the gentleman?"</p>

<p>"No. His name is Decker. But he is engaged at present."</p>

<p>"I wish to see him personally."</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>"Thank you. I am in a great hurry."</p>

<p>"In that case, perhaps I can arrange an interview."</p>

<p>"I won't detain him a minute."</p>

<p>The clerk passed into the little private office, and Harry
heard the low hum of voices. Then the proprietor said:</p>

<p>"Send him in."</p>

<p>The salesman reappeared, nodded, smiled and said:</p>

<p>"Go right in, sir, through that door in the partition."</p>

<p>Harry pushed the door open.</p>

<p>It was a small room containing a desk at which sat a
bald-headed, little, old man with a mass of diamonds spread
before him on the desk.</p>

<p>He had a magnifying glass in his eye, a pair of tweezers
in his hand, and a small delicate scale in front of him.</p>

<p>Evidently he had been weighing and sizing up the stones.</p>

<p>In a chair beside him sat Clara La Croix!</p>

<p>As Harry stepped forward with a smile on his face, their
glances met.</p>

<p>She half started from her chair, uttering a smothered
cry of intense dismay, and her face turned as pale as death.</p>

<p>"Young King Brady!" she gasped, faintly.</p>

<p>"Clara, I've run you down at last!"</p>

<p>She fairly groaned.</p>

<p>Her defeat was hard to bear.</p>

<p>"This is terrible!" she muttered.</p>

<p>Harry pointed at the diamonds in front of the astonished
dealer.</p>

<p>"Ain't those the smuggled diamonds?" he asked.</p>

<p>Before she could reply, Mr. Decker sprang to his feet, crying
in alarm:</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Are these smuggled diamonds?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Harry, with a nod.</p>

<p>"No wonder she wanted to sell them so cheap!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Decker, I am a Custom House officer."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"This girl is a smuggler."</p>

<p>"I see!"</p>

<p>"We've been on her trail since she brought those gems
from Holland to Canada, and thence over the border without
paying duty on them."</p>

<p>"The little wretch!"</p>

<p>"Are you a party to this deal?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" emphatically replied the dealer. "I'm a
victim. She came in a while ago and said her father died,
leaving a stock of diamonds to her as he had been an importer.
As she offered to sell them very cheap, I was selecting
a lot to buy, when you came in."</p>

<p>"I believe you, sir."</p>

<p>"I am a respectable business man."</p>

<p>"Oh, there can't be any doubt of that. This girl is
developing into one of the most expert crooks in the country.
For her own good it's a blessing that I've caught her
before she gets any worse."</p>

<p>"That's a fact."</p>

<p>"Kindly gather up those gems in a package for me."</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'm glad you arrived in time to save me
from buying goods of this kind. I have no desire to do
any crooked business."</p>

<p>He made a package of the diamonds.</p>

<p>Harry then turned his attention to Clara who was weeping
bitterly and said to her in low tones:</p>

<p>"There's no use playing the baby act. We've got your
father, mother and the four spies. You and the diamonds
are the last of the bunch."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to go to prison," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"I can't help that. You've broken the law and now you
have got to take the consequence of your evildoing."</p>

<p>"Can't you let me go?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I'll give you all those diamonds if you do."</p>

<p>"My dear girl, I'm going to take them anyway."</p>

<p>"But I mean for keeps. They're worth $250,000."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't let you go for ten times that amount."</p>

<p>"Very well," she replied, despairingly, "take me."</p>

<p>"If you'll go along peacefully I won't handcuff you and
I'll take you in a cab so people won't be staring."</p>

<p>"You are very kind. I'll do anything you ask."</p>

<p>Harry took the diamonds from Mr. Decker and ranging
himself alongside of the girl he led her down to the street.</p>

<p>A cab was procured and they drove away.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>After Andrew Gibson rushed from the room in the Astor
House, Old King Brady walked over to Paul La Croix and
asked him:</p>

<p>"Were you going to sell him your diamonds?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sair," admitted the terrified prisoner, "but, by gar,
I deed not know zat he was wong Custom House inspectair."</p>

<p>"Well, that's exactly what he was."</p>

<p>"Hark! What eez zat?"</p>

<p>"Gibson in the hall, yelling bloody murder."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>"Ze man ees crazy!"</p>

<p>Old King Brady was puzzled by the defeated inspector's
actions. But he soon was destined to learn what the man
meant by it.</p>

<p>His yells brought up a policeman at the head of a crowd.</p>

<p>"What's the fuss about?" demanded the patrolman.</p>

<p>"See this badge?" demanded Gibson.</p>

<p>"Yes. You're a Custom House officer."</p>

<p>"That's what I am. I'm after a smuggler."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"He's in that room. Just as I was going to arrest him
a friend of his rushed in, armed with a gun and gave me
a punch in the eye."</p>

<p>"I see he did."</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to arrest that fellow, so I can take in
the smuggler."</p>

<p>"Very well. Come and point him out to me."</p>

<p>Gibson rushed to the door and flung it open.</p>

<p>Striking a dramatic attitude and pointing at Old King
Brady, he shouted in ferocious tones:</p>

<p>"There stands the man. Arrest him!"</p>

<p>Old King Brady was astonished to hear this, and bristling
up with just indignation, he demanded:</p>

<p>"Of what does this man accuse me?"</p>

<p>"Interfering with an officer in the discharge of his duty."</p>

<p>Instantly comprehending Gibson's game, the old detective
burst out laughing, and finally asked:</p>

<p>"How did I interfere with him?"</p>

<p>"He was arresting yonder man, he says."</p>

<p>"Lock him up, officer!" shouted the inspector. "Lock
him up!"</p>

<p>The policeman took a firmer grip on his club and made a
rush at Old King Brady, whom he grasped by the collar.</p>

<p>"You're my prisoner!" he exclaimed. "If you resist,
I'll club you!"</p>

<p>While this was going on, Gibson grabbed La Croix and
dragged him over to the door, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"You come with me!"</p>

<p>He designed to arrest the man and get the credit for
it, while Old King Brady was fighting with the policeman.</p>

<p>But his plot was doomed to dismal failure.</p>

<p>Old King Brady flung back the lapel of his vest, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Do you know I'm Old King Brady, the Secret Service
detective?"</p>

<p>"What!" gasped the policeman, glaring at his badge.</p>

<p>"If you don't believe it, you can come to the station
when I pull in my prisoner. That fellow is a Custom
House inspector all right, but he's sailing under false
colors. We were both after the same man, as I am working
for the Custom House. I caught the man, and now he
wants to take the glory of the capture. See through his
game?"</p>

<p>The policeman did.</p>

<p>He released the detective.</p>

<p>Then he made a rush at the spiteful inspector, and poking
and jabbing him with his club, he put Gibson out of
the hotel.</p>

<p>The inspector finding himself baffled, departed in a
fury for the whole crowd was laughing and jeering at him,
and one of the spectators threatened to report his meanness
to the Collector.</p>

<p>Old King Brady now seized La Croix.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the policeman he went to the Church
street station and there met Harry, who had just brought
in Clara.</p>

<p>The prisoners were put in cells and the Bradys departed.</p>

<p>Going straight to the Custom House, they were ushered
into the Collector's room and gave him the details of their
work from start to finish.</p>

<p>When Harry handed over the seized diamonds he was
delighted, and praised the pair in the most glowing terms
for their efficient work.</p>

<p>He declared that they had broken up the most dangerous
gang of smugglers who ever infested the United States, and
expressed his regret that he was unable to keep them permanently
on his staff.</p>

<p>Gibson, he declared, would be dismissed in disgrace.</p>

<p>The detectives then went to Secret Service headquarters
and reported to their own chief, saying their work for the
Custom House was finished.</p>

<p>Soon after that the trial and conviction of the La Croixs
and their accomplices took place.</p>

<p>It is safe to assume that they got the extreme penalty of
the law upon the evidence furnished by the Bradys.</p>

<p>When they were disposed of, the Secret Service detectives
returned to their regular duties on the force.</p>

<p>It was not long after that, when one of the most startling
events in their lives occurred. This happened when they
were detailed upon a Secret Service case. The adventures
they met with were of the most thrilling description. Their
lives were threatened by dangers, and they did some of the
most marvellous work ever known in the department. But
want of space here prohibits our giving the details in this
story. We have reserved it for a new tale which will be
issued in our next number.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
